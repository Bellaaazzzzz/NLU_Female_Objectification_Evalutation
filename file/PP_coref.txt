[Illustration]   _Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” a fine and just distinction between “loving by allowance” and “loving with personal love applies to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, a fine and just distinction between “loving by allowance” and “loving with personal love brings a curious consequence with a fine and just distinction between “loving by allowance” and “loving with personal love. There is much more difference as to the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection's best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to  be the right and proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger Abbey, _Northanger Abbey's completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted critical facts that Northanger Abbey's scale is small, and Northanger Abbey's scheme, after all, that of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling in interest's exquisite delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked Edmund, and that Fanny might very likely have taken Crawford if Crawford had been a little more assiduous; yet  the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but Sense and Sensibility does not want perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers._  _I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss Austen be not of a fondness for Miss Austen a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity) would go forthe present book. _the present book is the larger, the more varied, the more popular; the author had by the time of the present book's composition seen rather more of the world, and had improved the author's general, though not the author's most peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand, I, for I's part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It seems to I the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most e minently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention in such narrow space as is permitted to me, me propose here to show cause._  _In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the reader) was in the book's first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796, when its author’s was barely twenty-one; though the book was revised and finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till 1813, only four years before its author’s's death. me do not know whether, in this combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, the book possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de théâtre; _The elopement of Lydia and Wickham  connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety. All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr. Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think the best feature of Emma. Although Miss Austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded Miss Austen's opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently, Miss Austen has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from the gra dual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, the attempt would certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction, which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can avail the novelist, appear at once on the stage._  _I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. construction sets off the novelist's other gifts and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of construction will sometimes mar his other gifts and graces--appreciably, though not quite consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But  a very badly-built novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if the story did not contain what seem to I the very masterpieces of Miss Austen's humour and of Miss Austen's faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to John Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others's company, but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still superior to John Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others._  _The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate that The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to express, and at any particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different persons. To I Miss Austen’s humour seems to posse ss a greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course, obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much, for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch, avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the savagery of Swift, the mildness of Jane Austen’s with the boisterousness of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that Jane Austen’s's immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much protest. Yet, bo th in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century, of course, could push an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool further than a lady in the early nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen's principles, as well as Miss Austen's heart, would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world, how his wife and his's friend induce his to play at blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures Mr. Shapely that “Mr. Shapely admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the days of a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet's great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen's own, such as Miss Austen's satire of Mrs.  Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over Musgrove’s's son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous falsification of this word “cynical”'s original sense, this word “cynical” is applied, not to rough and snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. Miss Austen may even have been one in the further sense that, like Miss Austen's own Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at work Miss Austen's fools and Miss Austen's mean persons. I think Miss Austen did take this delight, and I do not think at all the worse of Miss Austen for take as a wo man, while she was immensely the better for it as an artist._  _In respect of she's art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of her art, combined with the narrowness of she's field;” and Mr. Goldwin Smith has justly added that we need not go beyond she's own comparison to the art of a miniature painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in the term miniature's restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than of Cosway or any of Cosway's kind. And I am not so certain that I should I use the word “narrow” in connection with she. If she's world is a microcosm, the cosmic quality of her world is at least as eminent as the littleness. she does not touch what she did not feel she called to paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel she called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of  writing--one of about three years, and another of not much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in she's composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly anybody born in she's decade--that of the eighteenth-century seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and German to enable them to chip the classical shell. she was an English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce ladies's kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears, when ladies's studies, ladies's ways, ladies's conduct were subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular taste or judgment. she, too, drew back when the white fros t touched her shoes; but I think her would have made a pretty good journey even in a black one._  _For if her's knowledge was not very extended, her knew two things which only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the first head her could not make a mistake; her's men, though limited, are true, and her's women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if her has never tried idealism, her's realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch almost any Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what almost any Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant gives, you can shape a real impression out of the rest. But with her Miss Austen the myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic. Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book only) Mr. Collins changed Mr. Collins's mind from Jane to Elizab eth “while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought Mr. Darcy's coffee-cup back_ Mr. Darcy,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put Miss Austen to Addison in others._  _This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as This Swiftian quality appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins. the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for SwiftSwift. It has been said that no one ever was like the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins. But in the first place,_ the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins _was like the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins; the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is ra sh, I think, to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first draught, or an unsuccessful study of an actual Mr. Collins, in John Dashwood. The formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but a spoiled first draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. an actual Mr. Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the “miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity, humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity's Philistinism, humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity's well-meaning but hide-bound morality, humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity's formal pettiness, humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity's grovelling respect for rank, humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity's materialism, humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity's selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech or one action of an actual Mr. Collins is incapable of being reconciled with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions are hi storically true._  _But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if Mr. Collins's creatress had not adjusted so artfully to Mr. Collins the figures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, like Mr. Collins, has been charged with exaggeration. There is, perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for charged; but charged seems to me very faint indeed. Even now me do not think that it would be impossible to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners, as Lady Catherine de Bourgh. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish, rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present these agreeable characteristics which seldom present themselves now now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even Miss Elizabeth Miss Elizabeth herself, were, me am inclined to think, rather hard on  him for the “impropriety” of him's conduct. him's wife was evidently, and must always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless him had shot His wife or him there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic. From no other point of view is him open to any reproach, except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement, and him's utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that even Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of even Miss Austen's characters. It is difficult to know whether him is most agreeable when talking to His wife, or when putting Mr. Collins through Mr. Collins's paces; but the general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank him's consolation to the former when His wife maunders over the entail, “My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter us that_ I _may be the survivor;” and him's i nquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just related as made by Mr. Collins to Lady Catherine, “May his ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as These are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction outside of these four._  _The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether Mrs. Bennet is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects o f folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has taken rather less pains, though Miss Austen has been even more unkind to Mary; not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which Miss Austen has given us, in dooming Mary privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but perhaps Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not to extend to Mary a share of the respect and affection (affection and respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr. Collins, when Mr. Collins draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite these personages, and thus at  once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._  _The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de Bourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment, further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (Charlotte Lucas's egregious papa, though delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and that Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte Lucas what Charlotte Lucas is, yet not disagreeable; Wickham what Wickham is, without investing Wickham either with a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._  _Miss Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of Miss Austen’s's heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney, who se part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in his pride's expression and later in his pride's yielding, while his's falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I cannot go with the objectors. his's own account of the way in which his's had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in his is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his's demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had his been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, his might have been still smarting under his's rejection, or suspicious that Elizabeth’s had come husband-hunting. his's being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the comm on sense, but not really injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his's unregenerate state, only Elizabeth has of course not counted in what was due to Elizabeth's own personal charm._  _The secret of her own personal charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen Miss Austen herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms her own personal charm is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_ allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen herself was always provokingly chary of description in regard to Miss Austen herself's beauties; and except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that Miss Austen herself had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing about Miss Austen herself's looks. But Miss Austen herself's chief difference from other heroines of the lively type seems to lie first in Miss Austen herself being distinctly clever--almost strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable wor d--and secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her's propensity to tease and the sharpness of her's tongue. her can give at least as good as her gets when her is attacked; but her never “scratches,” and her never attacks first. Some of the merest obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her's early speeches a slight pertness, but a slight pertness is nothing, and when her comes to serious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is, as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the final ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, her is unexceptionable. Then too her is a perfectly natural girl. her does not disguise from her or anybody that her resents Darcy's first ill-mannered personality with as personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have been heard in more than o ne ball-room during this very year from persons who ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the injury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of she's family aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._  _Still, all this does not explain she's charm, which, taking beauty as a common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to she's playfulness, she's wit, she's affectionate and natural disposition, of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of she's type and age. Nearly all of heroines of her type and age would have been in speechless awe of Darcy; nearly all of heroines of her type and age would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham. Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the “New Woman” about she, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”) women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully she if all men choose, and th at most will away with her if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,” her has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of passion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of these qualities, that Miss Austen’s has not made her outwardly passionate. But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that her would have married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with Pemberley, and anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’ conversations in the final chapters so frigid as the lovers’ might have looked to the Della Cruscans of the lovers’'s own day, and perhaps do look to the Della Cruscans of this._  _And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where its is not. In the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young  ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can help doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth Bennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara Grant. me should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone Lavington; me should, me think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana Vernon and Barbara Grant. But to live with and to marry, me do not know that any one of Elizabeth Bennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara Grant can come into competition with Elizabeth Bennet._

possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.  However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on such a man's first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that such a man is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of the surrounding families's daughters.  “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said My dear Mr. Bennet's lady to My dear Mr. Bennet one day, “have My dear Mr. Bennet heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”  My dear Mr. Bennet replied that My dear Mr. Bennet had not.  “But Netherfield Park is,” returned My; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and Mrs. Long told My all about Netherfield Park.”  My dear Mr. Bennet made no answer.  “Do not My dear Mr. Bennet want to know who has taken Netherfield Park?” cried My, impatiently.  “_My dear Mr. Bennet_ want to tell My dear Mr. Bennet, and My dear Mr. Bennet have no objection to hearing it .”  [Illustration:  “He came down to see the place”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  This was invitation enough.  “Why, my dear, my dear must know, Mrs. Long says that the place is taken by He; that He came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with the place that He agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that He is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of He's servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”  “What is He's name?”  “Bingley.”  “Is He married or single?”  “Oh, single, my's , to be sure! He What a fine thing for our girls!”  “How so? how can it affect our girls?”  “my,” replied my's wife, “how can my be so tiresome? my must know that his wife am thinking of He's marrying one of our girls.”  “Is that He's design in settling here?”  “Design? Nonsense, how can my talk so! But it is very likely that He _may_ fall my n love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as him comes.”  “you see no occasion for visit. you and the girls may go--or you may send the girls by the girls, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, him might like you the best of the party.”  “you, you flatter you. you certainly _have_ had you's share of beauty, but you do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, a woman ought to give over thinking of a woman's own beauty.”  “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”  “But, you, you must indeed go and see him when him comes into the neighbourhood.”  “go is more than you engage for, you assure you.”  “But consider the girls. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of the girls. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, Sir William and Lady Lucas visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_  to visit him, if you do not.”  “you are over scrupulous, surely. you dare say him will be very glad to see you; and you will send a few lines by you to assure him of you's hearty consent to him's marrying whichever him chooses of the girls--though you must throw in a good word for you's little Lizzy.”  “you desire you will do no such thing. my little Lizzy is not a bit better than the others: and you am sure my little Lizzy is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _my little Lizzy_ the preference.”  “the others have none of them much to recommend the others,” replied you: “the others are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but my little Lizzy has something more of quickness than my little Lizzy's sisters.”  “you, how can you abuse you's own children in such a way? you take delight in vexing you. you have no compassion on you's poor nerves.”  “you mistake you, you. you have a high respect for my poor nerves. my poor nerves are you's old friends. you have heard you mention my poor nerves with consideration these twenty years at least.”  “Ah , you do not know what I suffer.”  “But I hope I will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”  “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since I will not visit twenty such.”  “Depend upon it, I, that when there are twenty, I will visit twenty.”  I was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make I's wife understand I's character. _his wife's_ mind was less difficult to develope. his wife was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When his wife was discontented, his wife fancied his wife nervous. The business of his wife's life was to get his wife's daughters married: The business of her life's solace was visiting and news.  [Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     [Illustration:  “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER II.   [Illustration]  Mr.  Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.  Bennet had always intended to visit Mr. Bingley, though to the last always assuring  Bennet's wife that  Bennet should not go; and till the evening after visit was paid his wife had no knowledge of visit. visit was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing  Bennet's second daughter employed in trimming a hat,  Bennet suddenly addressed his second daughter's with,--  “ Bennet hope Mr. Bingley will like it, his second daughter.”  “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said his second daughter's , resentfully, “since We are not to visit.”  “But his wife forget, his wife,” said Elizabeth, “that We shall meet Mr. Bingley at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce Mr. Bingley.”  “his wife do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. Mrs. Long has two nieces of Mrs. Long's own. Mrs. Long is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and his wife have no opinion of Mrs. Long.”  “No more have  Bennet,” said  Bennet; “and  Bennet am glad to find that his wife do not depend on Mrs. Long serving his wife.”   Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contai n herself, began scolding one of herself's daughters.  “Don’t keep coughing so, one of her daughters, for heaven’s sake! Have a little compassion on herself's nerves. one of her daughters tear my nerves to pieces.”  “one of her daughters has no discretion in one of her daughters's coughs,” said one of her daughters's father; “one of her daughters times my nerves ill.”  “one of her daughters do not cough for one of her daughters's own amusement,” replied one of her daughters, fretfully. “When is one of her daughters's next ball to be, one of her daughters?”  “To-morrow fortnight.”  “Ay, so it is,” cried one of her daughters's , “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for Mrs. Long to introduce him, for Mrs. Long will not know him Mrs. Long.”  “Then, one of her daughters, one of her daughters may have the advantage of one of her daughters, and introduce him to _Mrs. Long's_.”  “Impossible, herself, impossible, when one of her daughters am not acquainted with him one of her daughters; how can herself be so teasing?”  “herself honour one of her daughters's circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and Mrs. Long's nieces must  stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, you will take the office on you.”  The girls stared at The girls's . Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!”  “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried you. “Do Mrs. Bennet consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on the forms of introduction, as nonsense? you cannot quite agree with Mrs. Bennet _there_. What say Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet? For Mrs. Bennet are a young lady of deep reflection, you know, and read great books, and make extracts.”  Mrs. Bennet wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.  “While Mrs. Bennet is adjusting Mrs. Bennet's ideas,” you continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”  “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried I.  “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did Mrs. Bennet not tell I so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on Mr. Bingley. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”  The astonishment of The girls was  just what he wished--that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, Mrs. Bennet began to declare that it was what Mrs. Bennet had expected all the while.  “How good it was in Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet! But Mrs. Bennet knew Mrs. Bennet should persuade Mrs. Bennet at last. Mrs. Bennet was sure Mrs. Bennet loved Mrs. Bennet's girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased Mrs. Bennet am! And it is such a good joke, too, that Mrs. Bennet should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.”  “Now, Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet may cough as much as Mrs. Bennet choose,” said Mrs. Bennet; and, as Mrs. Bennet spoke, Mrs. Bennet left the room, fatigued with the raptures of Mrs. Bennet.  “What an excellent father your girls have, your girls,” said Mrs. Bennet, when the door was shut. “Mrs. Bennet do not know how your girls will ever make Mrs. Bennet amends for Mrs. Bennet's kindness; or Mrs. Bennet either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant, Mrs. Bennet can tell your girls, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your girls's sakes our would do anything. Lydia, Mrs. Bennet's love, though Lydia _are_ the youngest, Mrs. Bennet  dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”  “Oh,” said you, stoutly, “you am not afraid; for though you _am_ the youngest, you’m the tallest.”  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon Mr. Bingley would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask Mr. Bingley to dinner.  [Illustration: “you’m the tallest”]     [Illustration:       “Mr. Bingley rode a black horse” ]     CHAPTER III.   [Illustration]  Not all that Mr. Bennet’s, however, with the assistance of Mr. Bennet’s's five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from Mr. Bennet’s's husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. her five daughters attacked Mr. Bingley in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but Mr. Bingley eluded the skill of her five daughters; and her five daughters were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of her five daughters's neighbour, Lady Lucas. their neighbour, Lady Lucas's report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, an d, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of he's heart were entertained.  “If I can but see one of I's daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said I to I's , “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”  In a few days he returned I's visit, and sat about ten minutes with I in I's library. he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw I. the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much were somewhat more fortunate, for the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that I wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had I planned the courses that were to do credit to I's housekeeping, when an answer arrived whi ch deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. Mrs. Bennet could not imagine what business Mr. Bingley could have in town so soon after Mr. Bingley's arrival in Hertfordshire; and Mrs. Bennet began to fear that Mr. Bingley might always be flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as Mr. Bingley ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted Lady Lucas's fears a little by starting the idea of Mr. Bingley's  [Illustration:       “When the Party entered”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with Mr. Bingley to the assembly. twelve ladies grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, Mr. Bingley had brought only six with Mr. Bingley from London, Mr. Bingley's five sisters and a cousin. And when twelve ladies and seven gentlemen entered the assembly-ro om, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, Mr. Bingley's two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.  Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: Mr. Bingley had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his two sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. Mr. Bingley's brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked Mr. Bingley; but Mr. Bingley's friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his friend Mr. Darcy's fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after his friend Mr. Darcy's entrance, of his friend Mr. Darcy's having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced his friend Mr. Darcy to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared his friend Mr. Darcy was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and his friend Mr. Darcy was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his friend Mr. Darcy's manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his friend Mr. Darcy's popularity; for his friend Mr. Darcy was discovered to be proud, to be above his friend Mr. Darcy's company, and above being pleased; and not all his friend Mr. Darcy's large estate in Derbyshire could save his friend Mr. Darcy  from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.  his friend had soon made his friend acquainted with all the principal people in the room: his friend was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one his friend at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for Such amiable qualities. What a contrast between his friend and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with his friend, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of Mr. Darcy's own party. Mr. Darcy's character was decided. Mr. Darcy was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that Mr. Darcy would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against Mr. Darcy was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of Mr. Darcy's general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by Mr. Darcy's having slighted one of Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters's daughters.  Elizabeth Bennet had b een obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of two dances, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for Mr. Darcy to overhear a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press een to join the dance.  “Come, Mr. Darcy,” said Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it, “Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it must have Mr. Darcy dance. Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it hate to see Mr. Darcy standing about by Mr. Darcy in this stupid manner. Mr. Darcy had much better dance.”  “Mr. Darcy certainly shall not. You know how Mr. Darcy detest dance, unless Mr. Darcy am particularly acquainted with Mr. Darcy's partner. At such an assembly as this, dance would be insupportable. Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it's sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to Mr. Darcy to stand up with.”  “Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it would not be so fastidious as Mr. Darcy are,” cried Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it, “for a kingdom! Upon Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it's honour, Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it never met with so many pleasant girls in Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it's life as Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it have this evening; and there are several of so many pleasant girls, you see, uncommonly pretty.”  “_Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,”  said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.  “Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet is the most beautiful creature Mr. Darcy ever beheld! But there is one of the eldest Miss Bennet's sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and Mr. Darcy dare say very agreeable. Do let Mr. Darcy ask Mr. Darcy's partner to introduce you.”  [Illustration:  “one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable is tolerable”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  “Which do Mr. Darcy mean?” and turning round, Mr. Darcy looked for a moment at one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable, till, catching one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable's eye, Mr. Darcy withdrew Mr. Darcy's own, and coldly said, “one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _Mr. Darcy_; and Mr. Darcy am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. you had better return to my partner and enjoy my partner's smiles, for you are wasting you's time with Mr. Darcy.”  you followed Mr. Darcy's advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable remained with no very cordial feelings towards Mr. Darcy. one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable told the story, however, with great spirit among one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable's friends; for one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridic ulous.  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen Mrs. Bennet's eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her eldest daughter's twice, and her eldest daughter had been distinguished by Mr. Bingley's sisters. her eldest daughter was as much gratified by this as her eldest daughter's could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt her eldest daughter's pleasure. Mary had heard Mary mentioned to Miss Mr. Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that Catherine and Lydia had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where They lived, and of which They were the principal inhabitants. They found Mrs. Bennet still up. With a book, Mrs. Bennet was regardless of time; and on the present occasion Mrs. Bennet had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. Mrs. Bennet had rather hoped that all Mrs. Bennet's wife’s views on the stran ger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.  “Oh, he's dear Mr. Bennet,” as he entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. he wish my dear Mr. Bennet had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well Jane looked; and Mr. Bingley thought Jane quite beautiful, and danced with Jane's twice. Only think of _that_, my dear Mr. Bennet: Mr. Bingley actually danced with Jane's twice; and Jane was the only creature in the room that Mr. Bingley asked a second time. First of all, Mr. Bingley asked Miss Lucas. he was so vexed to see Mr. Bingley stand up with Miss Lucas; but, however, Mr. Bingley did not admire Miss Lucas at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and Mr. Bingley seemed quite struck with Jane as Jane was going down the dance. So Mr. Bingley inquired who Jane was, and got introduced, and asked Jane for the two next. Then, the two third Mr. Bingley danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Miss Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”   “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried he impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of he's partners. O that he had sprained he's ancle in the first dance!”  “Oh, me's dear,” continued me, “me am quite delighted with he. he is so excessively handsome! and he's sisters are charming women. me never in me's life saw anything more elegant than his sisters's dresses. me dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”  Here me was interrupted again. me protested against any description of finery. me was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.  “But me can assure he,” me added, “that he does not lose much by not suiting _he's_ fancy; for Mr. Darcy is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring Mr. Darcy! Mr. Darcy walked here, and Mr. Darcy walked there, fancying Mr. Darcy so  very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, you, to have given him one of you's set-downs. I quite detest him.”     [Illustration]     CHAPTER IV.   [Illustration]  When you and Elizabeth were alone, youyou's him , expressed to Elizabeth how very much you admired him.  “him is just what a young-man ought to be,” said you, “sensible, good-humoured, lively; and you never saw such happy manners! so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”  “him is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be if a young man possibly can. a young man's character is thereby complete.”  “you was very much flattered by him's asking you to dance a second time. you did not expect such a compliment.”  “Did not you? _you_ did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _you_ never. What could be more natural than him's asking you again? him could not help seeing tha t you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, his certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like his. you have liked many a stupider person.”  “you!”  “Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. you never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in you's eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in I's life.”  “you would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but you always speak what you think.”  “I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _you's_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with Affectation of candour everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody’s character and make everybody’s character still better, and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like his's sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal  to his.”  “Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with they. Miss Bingley is to live with Miss Bingley's brother, and keep her brother's house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in Miss Bingley.”  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than Elizabeth's sister, and with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to Elizabeth, Elizabeth was very little disposed to approve their. their were, in fact, very fine ladies; not deficient in good-humour when their were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where their chose being; but proud and conceited. their were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the habit of spending more than their ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were, therefore, in every resp ect entitled to think well of ect and meanly of others. ect were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on ect's memories than that ect's brother’s fortune and ect's own had been acquired by trade.  Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from Mr. Bingley's father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do purchase. Mr. Bingley intended purchase likewise, and sometimes made choice of Mr. Bingley's county; but, as Mr. Bingley was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of Mr. Bingley's temper, whether Mr. Bingley might not spend the remainder of Mr. Bingley's days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.  Mr. Bingley's sisters were very anxious for Mr. Bingley's having an estate of Mr. Bingley's own; but though Mr. Bingley was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at Mr. Bingley's table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion tha n fortune, less disposed to consider his house as his's home when his house suited his. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years when Mr. Bingley was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at his house. Mr. Bingley did look at his house, and into his house, for half an hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took his house immediately.  Between Mr. Bingley and his there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. Mr. Bingley was endeared to his by the easiness, openness, and ductility of Mr. Bingley's temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to Mr. Bingley's own, and though with Mr. Bingley's own Mr. Bingley never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of his's regard, Mr. Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of Mr. Bingley's judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, his was the superior. Mr. Bingley was by no means deficient; but his was clever. his was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his's manners, though well bred,  were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. his friend was sure of being liked wherever his friend appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. his friend had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his friend's life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to his friend; there had been no formality, no stiffness; his friend had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, his friend could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom Darcy had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet Darcy acknowledged to be pretty; but Miss Bennet smiled too much.  Mrs. Hurst and Mrs. Hurst's sister allowed smiled to be so; but still Mrs. Hurst and her sister admired Miss Bennet and liked Miss Bennet, and pronounced Miss Bennet to be a sweet girl, and one whom Mrs. Hurst and her sister should not object to know more of. M iss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of iss Bennet as their brother chose.     [Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER V.   [Illustration]  Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where Sir William Lucas had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during Sir William Lucas's mayoralty. the honour of knighthood had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. the honour of knighthood had given Sir William Lucas a disgust to Sir William Lucas's business and to Sir William Lucas's residence in a small market town; and, quitting them both, Sir William Lucas had removed with Sir William Lucas's family to a house about a mile from Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, denominated from that period Sir William Lucas Lodge; where Sir William Lucas could think with pleasure of Sir William Lucas's own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy Sir William Lucas solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by Sir William Lucas's rank, his rank did not render Sir William Lucas supercilious; on th e contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, he's presentation at St. James’s had made he courteous.  Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of several children, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.  That They Mrs. Bennet should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.  “_Lady Lucas_ began the evening well, Lady Lucas,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil self-command, to Lady Lucas. “_Lady Lucas_ were he's first choice.”  Lady LucasYes; but he seemed to like he's second better.”  “Oh, Mrs. Bennet mean Jane, Mrs. Bennet suppose, because he danced with Jane's twice. To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired Jane--indeed, Mrs. Bennet rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but Mrs. Bennet hardly know what--something about he obinson.”  “Perhaps you mean what you overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not you mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how him liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether him did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ him thought the prettiest? and him's answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”  “Upon you's word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”  “_you's_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _the eldest Miss Bennet_, the eldest Miss Bennet,” said you. “you is not so well worth listening to as you's friend, is you? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”  “you beg the eldest Miss Bennet will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by you's ill-treatment, for you is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by you. Mrs. Long told you last night that you sat close to Lizzy’s for half an hour without onc e opening his lips.”  [Illustration: “Without once opening his's lips”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  “Are you quite sure, you? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane. “Jane certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”  “Ay, because her asked Mr. Darcy at last how Mr. Darcy liked Netherfield, and Mr. Darcy could not help answering her; but her said Mr. Darcy seemed very angry at being spoke to.”  “Miss Bingley told Jane,” said Jane, “that Mr. Darcy never speaks much unless among Mr. Darcy's intimate acquaintance. With _his intimate acquaintance_ Mr. Darcy is remarkably agreeable.”  “you do not believe a word of it, Jane. If Mr. Darcy had been so very agreeable, Mr. Darcy would have talked to Mrs. Long. But you can guess how it was; everybody says that Mr. Darcy is eat up with pride, and you dare say Mr. Darcy had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise.”  “I do not mind Mr. Darcy not talking to Mrs. Long,” said I, “but I wish Mr. Darcy had danced with Eliza.”  “Another time, Lizzy,” said Lizzy's , “I would not dance with _hi m_, if I were you.”  “I believe, you, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”  “him's pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _Miss Lucas_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for His pride. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour's favour, should think highly of so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour. If Miss Lucas may so express it, him has a _right_ to be proud.”  “has is very true,” replied you, “and you could easily forgive _His pride, if him had not mortified _you_.”  “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections upon the solidity of Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections's reflections, “is a very common failing, Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections believe. By all that Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections have ever read, Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections am convinced that Pride is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to Pride, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though Vanity and pride are often used synonymously. A person may be proud  without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of our; vanity to what our would have others think of our.”  “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried II's , “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”  “Then I would drink a great deal more than I ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; “and if Mrs. Bennet were to see I at it, Mrs. Bennet should take away I's bottle directly.”  I protested that Mrs. Bennet should not; Mrs. Bennet continued to declare that Mrs. Bennet would; and the argument ended only with the visit.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]     CHAPTER VI.   [Illustration]  The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. the visit was returned in due form. Mrs. Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _the younger sisters_ was expressed towar ds the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in the two eldest's treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even Elizabeth's sister, and could not like the two eldest; though the two eldest's kindness to Jane, such as their kindness to Jane was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the influence of the two eldest's brother’s admiration. It was generally evident, whenever they met, that their brother’s _did_ admire Jane; and to _Jane's_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which Jane had begun to entertain for their brother’s from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but Elizabeth considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard Jane from the suspicions of the impertinent. Elizabeth mentioned this to Elizabeth's friend, Miss Lucas.  “It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied her friend, Miss Lucas, “to be able to impose on t he public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals a woman's affection with the same skill from the object of her affection, a woman may lose the opportunity of fixing the object of it; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of We who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection than a woman feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but Bingley may never do more than like your sister, if your sister does not help Bingley on.”  “But your sister does help Bingley on, as much as your sister's nature will allow. If _I_ can perceive your sister's regard for Bingley, Bingley must be a simpleton indeed not to discover her regard for him too.”  “Remember, your, that Bingley does not know Jane’s disposition as your do.”  “But if a woman I s partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out.”  “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though he and her meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as Bingley and Jane always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. her should therefore make the most of every half hour in which her can command he's attention. When her is secure of he, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as her chooses.”  “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if Elizabeth were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, Elizabeth dare say Elizabeth should adopt Your plan. But these are not her's feelings; her is not acting by design. As yet her cannot even be certain of the degree of her's own regard, nor of her own regard's reasonableness. her has known he only a fortnight. her danced four dances with he at Meryton; her saw he one m orning at his own house, and has since dined in company with his four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his's character.”  “Not as you represent it. Had her merely _dined_ with his, her might only have discovered whether his had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.”  “Yes: four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that them like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other leading characteristic, you do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”  “Well,” said you, “you wish her success with all you's heart; and if her were married to his to-morrow, you should think her had as good a chance of happiness as if her were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance the parties's felicit y in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have They's share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”  “You make me laugh, You; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that You would never act in this way You.”  Occupied in observing me's attention to You's sister, You was far from suspecting that You was You becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of You's friend. his friend had at first scarcely allowed You to be pretty: his friend had looked at You without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, his friend looked at You only to criticise. But no sooner had his friend made it clear to his friend and his friend's friends that You had hardly a good feature in You's face, than his friend began to find her face was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of You's dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though his friend had dete cted with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her's figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of he's asserting that her's manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by her manners's easy playfulness. Of this her was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made he agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.  he began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing with her he, attended to her's conversation with others. he's doing so drew her's notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.  “What does he mean,” said her to Charlotte, “by listening to her's conversation with Colonel Forster?”  “That is a question which he only can answer.”  “But if he does listening any more, her shall certainly let he know that her see what he is about. he has a very satirical eye, and if her do not begin by being impertinent her, her sha ll soon grow afraid of him.”  [Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  On him's approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied Miss Lucas's friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking her friend to do it, Miss Lucas turned to him and said,--  “Did not him think, him, that Miss Lucas expressed Miss Lucas uncommonly well just now, when Miss Lucas was teasing Colonel Forster to give them a ball at Meryton?”  “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.”  “Miss Lucas are severe on us.”  “It will be _her friend's_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “Miss Lucas am going to open the instrument, her friend, and her friend know what follows.”  “Miss Lucas are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting her friend to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If her friend's vanity had taken a musical turn, Miss Lucas would have been invaluable; but as it is, her friend would really rather not sit down before those who must be  in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, Miss Lucas’s added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and Miss Lucas’s shall keep Miss Lucas’s to swell Miss Lucas’s's song.”  Miss Lucas’s's performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before Miss Lucas’s could reply to the entreaties of several that Miss Lucas’s would sing again, Miss Lucas’s was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by Miss Lucas’s's sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.  Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given Mary's application, vanity had given Mary likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than Mary had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with m uch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of Mary's younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.  Mr. Darcy stood near her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by Mr. Darcy's own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was Mr. Darcy's neighbour, till Sir William Lucas thus began:--  “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing, after all. Sir William Lucas consider dancing as one of the first refinements of polished societies.”  “Certainly, Sir William Lucas; and this has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”  Sir William Lucas only smiled. “Mr. Darcy's friend performs delightfully,” Sir William Lucas continued, after a pause, on seeing Your friend join th e group; “and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science you, you.”  “I saw you dance at Meryton, you believe, I.”  “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”  “Never, I.”  “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to St. James’s?”  “it is a compliment which you never pay to any place if you can avoid it.”  “you have a house in town, I conclude?”  you bowed.  “you had once some thoughts of fixing in town you, for you am fond of superior society; but you did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”  you paused in hopes of an answer: but you's companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, you was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,--  “Elizabeth, why are not Elizabeth dancing? you, you must allow I to present Elizabeth to you as a very desirable partner. you cannot refus e to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.” And, taking you's hand, I would have given her hand to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive her hand, when you instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--  “Indeed, I, you have not the least intention of dancing. you entreat I not to suppose that you moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”  Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of you's hand, but in vain. you was determined; nor did I at all shake you's purpose by I's attempt at persuasion.  “you excel so much in the dance, you, that it is cruel to deny I the happiness of seeing you; and though I dislikes the amusement in general, I can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.”  “Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it is all politeness,” said you, smiling.  “Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it is, indeed: but considering the inducement, I's , we cannot wonder at Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it's complaisance; f or who would object to such a partner?”  Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Elizabeth's resistance had not injured Elizabeth with the gentleman, and the gentleman was thinking of Elizabeth with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--  “I can guess the subject of the gentleman's reverie.”  “Elizabeth should imagine not.”  “the gentleman are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of the gentleman's opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these people! What would I give to hear the gentleman's strictures on all these people!”  “I's conjecture is totally wrong, the gentleman assure I. the gentleman's mind was more agreeably engaged. the gentleman have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”  I immediately fixed I's eyes on the gentleman's face, and desired the gentleman would tell I what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. the gentleman replied, with great i ntrepidity,--  “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”  “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “Miss Bingley am all astonishment. How long has Miss Elizabeth Bennet been such a favourite? and pray when am Miss Bingley to wish Miss Elizabeth Bennet joy?”  “That is exactly the question which Miss Elizabeth Bennet expected Miss Bingley to ask. A lady’s imagination is very rapid; A lady’s imagination jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. Miss Elizabeth Bennet knew Miss Bingley would be wishing Miss Elizabeth Bennet joy.”  “Nay, if Miss Elizabeth Bennet are so serious about it, Miss Bingley shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. Miss Elizabeth Bennet will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course a charming mother-in-law will be always at Pemberley with Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”  Miss Elizabeth Bennet listened to Miss Bingley with perfect indifference, while Miss Bingley chose to entertain Miss Bingley in this manner; and as Miss Elizabeth Bennet's composure convinced Miss Bingley that all was safe, Miss Bingley's wit flowed along.     [Illustration:       “A note for Miss Elizabeth Bennet”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER VII.   [Illustration]  Miss Elizabeth Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for hi s daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s fortune, though ample for their mother’s's situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. their mother’s's father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left their mother’s's four thousand pounds.  their mother’s had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to Her father and succeeded Her father in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their's aunt, and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions: The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia's minds were more vacant than The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia,, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia's morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare  of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from they's aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head-quarters.  they's visits to their aunt were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to they's knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. they's lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers’the officers’. their aunt visited the officers’, and visited opened to their aunt's a source of felicity unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their aunt, was worthless in they's eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.  After listening one morning to they's effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed,--  “From all that Mr. Bennet can collect by  your manner of talking, your must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected be some time, but I am now convinced.”  Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express Lydia's admiration of Captain Carter, and Lydia's hope of seeing Captain Carter in the course of the day, as Captain Carter was going the next morning to London.  “I am astonished, I's dear,” said I, “that my dear should be so ready to think my dear's own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody’s children, anybody’s children should not be of I's own, however.”  “If your own children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of are.”  “Yes; but as it happens, your own children are all of them very clever.”  “This is the only point, I flatter I, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that we's sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from my dear as to think your uncommonly foolish.”  “I, I must not expect such girls to have the  sense of their father and mother. When their get to our age, I dare say their will not think about officers any more than our do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat I very well--and, indeed, so I do still at I's heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of I's girls, I shall not say nay to a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in Colonel Forster's regimentals.”  “I,” cried Lydia, “Lydia's aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as Colonel Forster and Captain Carter did when Colonel Forster and Captain Carter first came; my aunt sees Colonel Forster and Captain Carter now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”  I was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for I; a note for Miss Bennet came from Netherfield, and the footman with a note for Miss Bennet waited for an answer. I's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and I was eagerly calling out, while Lydia read,--  “Well, Lydia, who is a note for Miss Bennet from? What is a note for Miss Bennet about? What does he say? Well, Lydia e, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”  “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read It aloud.       /* NIND “NIND's dear friend, */       “If My dear friend are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and      NIND, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of we's      lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never      end without a quarrel. Come as soon as My dear friend can on the receipt of      It. NIND's brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.      Yours ever,  “Miss Bingley.”  “With the officers!” cried Lydia: “Lydia wonder Lydia's aunt did not tell us of _that_.”  “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “Dining is very unlucky.”  “Can Jane have the carriage?” said Jane.  “No, my's , Jane had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then Jane must stay all night.”  “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if My dear friend were sure that they would not offer to send Louisa's home.”  “Oh, but the gentlemen will have Miss Bingley's chaise  to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to the Hursts.”  “I had much rather go in the coach.”  “But, I, I's father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. the horses are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not the horses?”  [Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]  “the horses are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get the horses.”  “But if Mr. Bennet have got the horses to-day,” said I, “I's mother’s purpose will be answered.”  I did at last extort from your father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged; I was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and my mother’s attended I to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. I's hopes were answered; I had not been gone long before it rained hard. I's sisters were uneasy for I, but my mother’s was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; I certainly could not come back.  “This was a lucky idea of I, indeed!” said Mr. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all my mother’s's own. Till  the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of she's contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:--       /* NIND “NIND's dearest Lizzie, */       “NIND find NIND very unwell the next morning, which, NIND suppose, is to be      imputed to NIND's getting wet through yesterday. NIND's kind friends will      not hear of NIND's returning home till NIND am better. My kind friends insist also on NIND's NIND's seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if My dearest Lizzie should hear      of Mr. Jones's having been to NIND--and, excepting a sore throat and a      headache, there is not much the matter with NIND.  “My dearest Lizzie, etc.”  “Well, she,” said my, when Elizabeth:-- had read the following note aloud, “if Elizabeth:--'s should have a dangerous fit of illness--if My dearest Lizzie should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under Elizabeth:--'s orders.”  “Oh, Elizabeth:-- am not at all afraid of My dearest Lizzie's dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. My dearest Lizzie will be  taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see she if I could have the carriage.”  Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to she, though the carriage was not to be had: and as Elizabeth was no horsewoman, walking was Elizabeth's only alternative. Elizabeth declared Elizabeth's resolution.  “How can Elizabeth be so silly,” cried Elizabeth's mother, “as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! Elizabeth will not be fit to be seen when Elizabeth get there.Elizabeth  “Elizabeth shall be very fit to see she--which is all Elizabeth want.”  “Is this a hint to me, Elizabeth,” said me, “to send for the horses?”  “No, indeed. Elizabeth do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. Elizabeth shall be back by dinner.”  “I admire the activity of Elizabeth's benevolence,” observed I, “but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in I's opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”  “We will go as far as Meryton with Elizabeth,” said We ia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and their set off together.  “If their make haste,” said Lydia, as their walked along, “perhaps their may see something of Captain Carter, before Captain Carter goes.”  In Meryton their parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued Elizabeth's walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding Elizabeth at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.  Elizabeth was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where Elizabeth's appearance created a great deal of surprise. That Elizabeth should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather, and by Elizabeth, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley held Elizabeth in contempt for walked. Elizabeth was received, however, very politely by th em; and in their brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to The former's complexion and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying The former coming so far alone. Mr. Hurst was thinking only of Mr. Hurst's breakfast.  Mr. Hurst's inquiries after Mr. Hurst's sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave Miss Bennet's room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to Miss Bennet immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit's note how much Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit longed for such a visit, was delighted at Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit's entrance. Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was not equal, however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bennet left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was treated with. Elizabeth ntly attended her.  When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like the sisters Elizabeth, when Elizabeth saw how much affection and solicitude the sisters showed for her. The apothecary came; and having examined The apothecary's , said, as might be supposed, that her had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of a violent cold; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her's head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit Elizabeth's room for a moment, nor were the sisters often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.  When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that Elizabeth must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered Elizabeth the carriage, and Elizabeth only wanted a little pressing to accept the carriage, when her testified such concern at parting with Elizabeth that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to re main at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with Elizabeth's stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.  [Illustration:  “The Apothecary came” ]     [Illustration:  “covering a screen” ]     CHAPTER VIII.   [Illustration]  At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which Elizabeth had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much The sisters were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively The sisters disliked being ill The sisters; and then thought no more of the matter: and The sisters's indifference towards Jane, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all Elizabeth's original dislike.  The sisters's  brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and His's attentions to she most pleasing; and they prevented she feeling she so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. she had very little notice from any but His. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, Miss Bingley's sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom she sat, Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat found she prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to she.  When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing Miss Bingley as soon as she was out of the room. she's manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence: she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat thought the same, and added,--  “she has nothing, in short, to recommend she, but being an excellent walker. Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat shall never  forget her appearance this morning. her really looked almost wild.”  “her did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep I's countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _her_ be scampering about the country, because her's sister had a cold? her's hair so untidy, so blowzy!”  “Yes, and her's petticoat; Louisa hope I saw her's petticoat, six inches deep in mud, Louisa am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to hide her petticoat not doing the gown which had been let down to hide it's office.”  “Louisa's picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said I; “but this was all lost upon I. I thought her looked remarkably well when her came into the room this morning. her petticoat quite escaped I's notice.”  “_You_ observed her petticoat, You, Louisa am sure,” said I; “and Louisa am inclined to think that You would not wish to see _You's _ make such an exhibition.”  “Certainly not.”  “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her's ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could her m ean by it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”  “it shows an affection for me's sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.  “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Bingley, in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected Mr. Darcy's admiration of her sister's fine eyes.”  “Not at all,” Mr. Darcy replied: “her fine eyes were brightened by the exercise.” A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--  “Mrs. Hurst have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and Mrs. Hurst wish with all Mrs. Hurst's heart her sister were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, Mrs. Hurst am afraid there is no chance of were.”  “I think I have heard Bingley say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton?”  “Yes; and their have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”  “That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.  “If their had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it  would not make them one jot less agreeable.”  “But it must very materially lessen them's chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.  To this speech Bingley made no answer; but Bingley's sisters gave this speech his sisters's hearty assent, and indulged his sisters's mirth for some time at the expense of his sisters's vulgar relations.  With a renewal of tenderness, however, his sisters repaired to Bingley's room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with Bingley till summoned to coffee. Bingley was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit Bingley at all, till late in the evening, when Elizabeth had the comfort of seeing Bingley asleep, and when it appeared to Elizabeth rather right than pleasant that Elizabeth should go down stairs Elizabeth. On entering the drawing-room, Elizabeth found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join the whole party; but suspecting the whole party to be playing high, Elizabeth declined invited, and making Elizabeth's sister the excuse, said Elizabeth would amuse Elizabeth, for the short time Elizabeth could stay below, with a book. Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment.  “Do her prefer reading to cards?” said he; “prefer is rather singular.”  “her,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. her is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”  “her deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried her; “her am _not_ a great reader, and her have pleasure in many things.”  “In nursing her's sister Miss Bingley am sure her have pleasure,” said Miss Bingley; “and Miss Bingley hope pleasure will soon be increased by seeing your sister quite well.”  her thanked Miss Bingley from her's heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. Miss Bingley immediately offered to fetch her's others; all that Miss Bingley's library afforded.  “And Miss Bingley wish his library were larger for her's benefit and Miss Bingley's own credit; but Miss Bingley am an idle fellow; and though Miss Bingley have not many, Miss Bingley have more than Miss Bingley ever looked into.”  her assured Miss Bingley that her could suit her perfectly with those in the room.  “Miss Bingley am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that Miss Bingley's father should have left so  small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, you!”  “It ought to be good,” you replied: “It has been the work of many generations.”  “And then you have added so much to It you--you are always buying books.”  “you cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.”  “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of Pemberley. Charles, when Charles build _Charles's_ house, I wish your_ house may be half as delightful as Pemberley.”  “I wish your_ house may.”  “But I would really advise Charles to make Charles's purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.”  “With all Charles's heart: Charles will buy PemberleyPemberley, if you will sell Pemberley.”  “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”  “Upon I's word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”  Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave Elizabeth very little a ttention for her book; and, soon laying her book wholly aside, her drew near the card-table, and stationed her between Mr. Bingley and Mr. Bingley's eldest sister, to observe the game.  “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Mr. Bingley: “will Miss Darcy be as tall as Mr. Bingley am?”  “I think Miss Darcy will. Miss Darcy is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or rather taller.”  “How Mr. Bingley long to see Miss Darcy again! Mr. Bingley never met with anybody who delighted Mr. Bingley so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished for Miss Darcy's age! Miss Darcy's performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”  “It is amazing to Mr. Bingley,” said Mr. Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”  “All young ladies accomplished! I, what do I mean?”  “Yes, they all, I think. they all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that a young lady was very acco mplished.”  “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves The word no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but Darcy am very far from agreeing with Your in Your's estimation of ladies in general. Darcy cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of Darcy's acquaintance that are really accomplished.”  “Nor I, Your am sure,” said I.  “Then,” observed Your, “Your must comprehend a great deal in Your's idea of an accomplished woman.”  ”Yes; Your do comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.”  “Oh, certainly,” cried Your's faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, A woman must possess a certain something in A woman's air and manner of walking, the tone of A woman's voice, A woman's address and e xpressions, or the word will be but half deserved.”  “All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to All this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of she's mind by extensive reading.”  “I am no longer surprised at she's knowing _only_ six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at she's knowing _any_.”  “Are she so severe upon she's own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?”  “_she_ never saw such a woman. _she_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as I describe, united.”  Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of she's implied doubt, and were both protesting that Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley knew many women who answered this description, when Mrs. Hurst called Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley to order, with bitter complaints of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley's inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, she soon afterwards left the room.  “she,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on she, “is one of those young ladies who seek  to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing themselves's own; and with many men, I daresay, it succeeds; but, in I's opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”  “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, “there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.”  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.  Elizabeth joined them again only to say that Elizabeth was worse, and that Elizabeth could not leave Elizabeth. Miss Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for immediately; while Mr. Jones’s's sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians Elizabeth would not hear of; but Elizabeth was not so unwilling to comply with his sisters's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones’s should be sent for early in the morning, if Elizabeth were not decidedly better . Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that his sisters were miserable. his sisters solaced his sisters's wretchedness, however, by duets after supper; while his could find no better relief to his's feelings than by giving his's housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and the sick lady's sister.     [Illustration:  M^{rs} Bennet and M^{rs} Bennet's two youngest girls  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER IX.   [Illustration]  Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in Elizabeth's sister’s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which Elizabeth very early received from his by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his's . In spite of this amendment, however, Elizabeth requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring Elizabeth's mother to visit Jane, and form her mother's own judgment of Jane's situation. a note was immediately despatched, and a note's contents as quickly complied with. Mrs.  Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.  Had her found Jane in any apparent danger, her would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing Jane that Jane's illness was not alarming, her had no wish of Jane recovering immediately, as Jane's restoration to health would probably remove Jane from Netherfield. her would not listen, therefore, to Jane's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think being at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley’s appearance and invitation, her and three daughters all attended Miss Bingley’s into the breakfast parlour. Miss Bingley’s met the mother and three daughters all with hopes that her had not found Jane worse than her expected.  “Indeed her have, Miss Bingley’s,” was her's answer. “Jane is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving Jane. the mother and three daughters all must trespass a little longer on Miss Bingley’s's kindness.”  “Removed!” cr ied Bingley. “It must not be thought of. ied Bingley's sister, ied Bingley am sure, will not hear of her removal.”  “ied Bingley may depend upon it, ied Bingley,” said ied Bingley, with cold civility, “that her shall receive every possible attention while her remains with us.”  her was profuse in her's acknowledgments.  “her am sure,” her added, “if it was not for such good friends, her do not know what would become of her, for her is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for her has, without exception, the sweetest temper her ever met with. her often tell her's other girls my other girls are nothing to _her's_. ied Bingley have a sweet room here, ied Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. her do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. ied Bingley will not think of quitting it in a hurry, her hope, though ied Bingley have but a short lease.”  “Whatever ied Bingley do is done in a hurry,” replied ied Bingley; “and therefore if ied Bingley should resolve to quit  Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider I as quite fixed here.”  “consider is exactly what I should have supposed of I,” said I.  “I begin to comprehend I, do I?” cried I, turning towards I.  “Oh yes--I understand I perfectly.”  “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”  “That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as I.”  “I,” cried I's mother, “remember where I are, and do not run on in the wild manner that I are suffered to do at home.”  “I did not know before,” continued I, immediately, “that I were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”  IYes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. intricate characters have at least that advantage.”  “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourho od you move in a very confined and unvarying society.”  “But people people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in people themselves for ever.”  “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. “Mrs. Bennet assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.”  Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at Mrs. Bennet for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied Mrs. Bennet had gained a complete victory over his, continued Mrs. Bennet's triumph,--  “Mrs. Bennet cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for Mrs. Bennet's part, except the shops and public places. the country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not the country, his?”  “When his am in the country,” his replied, “his never wish to leave the country; and when his am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each They's advantages, and his can be equally happy in either.Mrs. Bennet  “Ay, that is because his have the right disposition. But his,” looking at Darcy, “seemed t o think the country was nothing at all.”  “Indeed, mamma, mamma are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for Elizabeth's . “mamma quite mistook o. o only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which mamma must acknowledge to be true.”  “Certainly, Elizabeth, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, mamma believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. mamma know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep Bingley's countenance. Bingley's was less delicate, and directed Elizabeth's eye towards o with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn Elizabeth's thoughts, now asked mamma if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _Charlotte Lucas's_ coming away.  “Yes, Charlotte Lucas called yesterday with Charlotte Lucas's father. What an agreeable man Bingley is, Bingley--is not Bingley? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! Bingley has a lways something to say to everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths very important and never open those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths's mouths quite mistake the matter.”  “Did Charlotte dine with my?”  “No, Charlotte would go home. my fancy Charlotte was wanted about the mince-pies. For my's part, Mr. Bingley, _my_ always keep servants that can do servants that can do their own work's own work; _my's_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to judge for everybody, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, my assure Mr. Bingley. It is a pity the Lucases are not handsome! Not that _my_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then Charlotte is our particular friend.”  “Charlotte seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Mr. Bingley.  “Oh dear, yes; but Mr. Bingley must own Charlotte is very plain. Lady Lucas Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied my Jane’s beauty. my do not like to boast of my's own child; but to be sure, Jane’s--one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. my do not trust my's own partiality. When Jane’s was only fiftee n there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my's sister-in-law was sure a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her did not. Perhaps a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her thought her too young. However, a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her wrote some verses on her, and very pretty some verses were.”  “And so ended a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her's affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has been many a one, Elizabeth fancy, overcome in the same way. Elizabeth wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”  “my have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said my.  “Of a fine, stout, healthy love poetry may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, my am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”  my only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest Elizabeth's should be exposing my again. Elizabeth longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence my began repe ating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for Mr. Bingley's kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling Mr. Bingley also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in Mr. Bingley's answer, and forced her to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. her performed her's part, indeed, without much graciousness, but Mr. Bingley was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered Mr. Bingley's carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of Mr. Bingley's daughters put the youngest of her daughters forward. her daughters had been whispering to each other during the whole visit; and the result of whispering was, that the youngest of her daughters should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on Mr. Bingley's first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.  the youngest of her daughters was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with the youngest of her daughters's the youngest of her daughters . the youngest of her daughters had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom the youngest of her daughters's uncle’s good dinn ers and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. her was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded Mr. Bingley of Mr. Bingley's promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if Mr. Bingley did not keep his promise. Mr. Bingley's answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her's ear.  “Mr. Bingley am perfectly ready, Mr. Bingley assure her, to keep Mr. Bingley's engagement; and, when her's sister is recovered, her shall, if her please, name the very day of the ball. But her would not wish to be dancing while your sister is ill?”  her declared her satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to wait till your sister was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _you's_ ball,” her added, “her shall insist on their giving one also. her shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if Colonel Forster does not.”  her and her's daughters then departed, and her returned instantly to your sister, leaving her's own a nd her relations’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in the two ladies's censure of _her's_, in spite of all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER X.   [Illustration]  The day passed much as the day before had done. the two ladies Miss Bingley’s had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, her joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley’s, seated near Mr. Darcy, was watching the progress of Mr. Darcy's letter, and repeatedly calling off Mr. Darcy's attention by messages to Mr. Darcy's sister. the two ladies Miss Bingley’s were at piquet, and the two ladies was observing the two ladies's game.  her took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Darcy's companion. The perpetual commendations of her either on Mr. Darcy's hand-writing, o r on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his's letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her's opinion of each.  “How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”  his made no answer.  “his write uncommonly fast.”  “her are mistaken. his write rather slowly.”  “How many letters his must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious her should think Letters of business!”  “It is fortunate, then, that Letters of business fall to his's lot instead of to her.”  “Pray tell her's sister that his long to see your sister.”  “her have already told your sister so once, by her's desire.”  “her am afraid his do not like his's pen. Let her mend your pen for his. her mend pens remarkably well.”  “Thank her--but his always mend his's own.”  “How can his contrive to write so even?”  his was silent.  “Tell your sister his am delighted to hear of your sister's improvement on the harp, and pray let your sister know that his am quite in raptures with your sister's bea utiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s.”  “Will I give I leave to defer I's raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do your raptures justice.”  “Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see Miss Grantley’s in January. But do I always write such charming long letters to Miss Grantley’s, I?I  “such charming long letters to her are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for I to determine.”  “It is a rule with I, that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill.”  “That will not do for a compliment to I, I,” cried I's brother, “because I does _not_ write with ease. I studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not I, I?”  “I's style of writing is very different from I.”  “Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. Charles leaves out half Charles's words, and blots the rest.”  “I's ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express My ideas; by which means I's letters sometimes convey no i deas at all to my correspondents.”  “my's humility, my,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”  “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of humility. the appearance of humility is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.”  “And which of the two do Darcy call _my's_ little recent piece of modesty?”  “an indirect boast; for my are really proud of my's defects in writing, because my consider your defects in writing as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, my think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When my told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that if my ever resolved on quitting Netherfield my should be gone in five minutes, my meant told to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to my; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necess ary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”  “Nay,” cried yourself, “this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon yourself's honour, yourself believed what yourself said of yourself to be true, and yourself believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, yourself did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”  “I daresay yourself believed it; but I am by no means convinced that yourself would be gone with such celerity. yourself's conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as yourself were mounting yourself's horse, a friend were to say, ‘yourself, yourself had better stay till next week,’ yourself would probably do it--yourself would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”  “yourself have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that yourself did not do justice to yourself's own disposition. yourself have shown yourself off now much more than yourself did yourself.”  “I am exceedingly gratif ied,” said Bingley, “by Bingley's converting what Bingley's friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of Bingley's temper. But Bingley am afraid Bingley are giving it a turn which my friend did by no means intend; for my friend would certainly think the better of Bingley if, under such a circumstance, Bingley were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as Bingley could.”  “Would my friend then consider the rashness of Bingley's original intention as atoned for by Bingley's obstinacy in adhering to your original intention?”  “Upon Bingley's word, Bingley cannot exactly explain the matter--my friend must speak for my friend.”  “Bingley expect Bingley to account for opinions which Bingley choose to call Bingley, but which Bingley have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to Bingley's representation, Bingley must remember, Bingley, that the friend who is supposed to desire the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan's return to the house, and the delay of the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan's plan, has merely desired his return to the house, asked his return to the house without offering one argument in favour of his return to the house's propriety.”  “To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend  is no merit with you.”  “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.”  “you appear to me, you, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into a request. me am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before We discuss the discretion of Mr. Bingley's behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend, where one of friend and friend is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of one of them for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into the desire?”  “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsistin g between the parties?”  “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting the parties's comparative height and size, for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than Miss Bennet may be aware of. Bingley assure Miss Bennet that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with Bingley, Bingley should not pay Darcy half so much deference. Bingley declare Bingley do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in particular places; at Darcy's own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when Darcy has nothing to do.”  Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought Elizabeth could perceive that Darcy was rather offended, and therefore checked Elizabeth's laugh. Bingley warmly resented the indignity Bingley had received, in an expostulation with Bingley's brother for talking such nonsense.  “I see Bingley's design, Bingley,” said I. “Bingley dislike an argument, and want to silence an argument.”  “Perhaps Bingley do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If I and Miss Bennet will defer you and Miss Bennet till Bingley am  out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of I.”  “What I ask,” said you, “is no sacrifice on you's side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish Mr. Darcy's letter.”  Mr. Darcy took you's advice, and did finish his letter.  When that business was over, Mr. Darcy applied to Miss Bingley and you for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request that you would lead the way, which you as politely and more earnestly negatived, Miss Bingley seated Miss Bingley.  Mrs. Hurst sang with Mrs. Hurst; and while they were thus employed, you could not help observing, as you turned over some music-books that lay on the pianoforte, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on you. you hardly knew how to suppose that you could be an object of admiration to Mr. Darcy, and yet that Mr. Darcy should look at you because Mr. Darcy disliked you was still more strange. you could only imagine, however, at last, that you  drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his's ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. her liked his too little to care for his's approbation.  After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards his, drawing near her, said to her,--  “Do her not feel a great inclination, her, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?”  her smiled, but made no answer. his repeated the question, with some surprise at her's silence.  “Oh,” said her, “her heard his before; but her could not immediately determine what to say in reply. his wanted her, her know, to say ‘Yes,’ that his might have the pleasure of despising her's taste; but her always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of those kind of schemes's premeditated contempt. her have, therefore, made up her's mind to tell his that her do not want to dance a reel at all; and now desp ise me if me dare.”  “Indeed me do not dare.”  Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront me, was amazed at me's gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in Elizabeth's manner which made it difficult for Elizabeth to affront anybody, and me had never been so bewitched by any woman as me was by Elizabeth. me really believed that, were it not for the inferiority of Elizabeth's connections, me should be in some danger.  Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and Miss Bingley's great anxiety for the recovery of Miss Bingley's dear friend Jane received some assistance from Miss Bingley's desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.  Miss Bingley often tried to provoke me into disliking her dear friend Jane, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning me's happiness in such an alliance.  “Miss Bingley hope,” said Miss Bingley, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, “they will give they's mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding your mother-in-law's tongue; and if they can compass it, to cure th e younger girls of running after the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.”  [Illustration:       “No, no; stay where you are”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  “Have I anything else to propose for your's domestic felicity?”  “Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your's uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips next to your's great-uncle the judge. your uncle and aunt Philips are in the same profession, your know, only in different lines. As for your lady's picture, your must not attempt to have your Elizabeth’s picture taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”  “It would not be easy, indeed, to catch those beautiful eyes's expression; but those beautiful eyes's colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.”  At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and your lady.  “I did not know that your lady intended to walk,” said I, in some  confusion, lest they had been overheard.  “You used they abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without telling they that You were coming out.”  Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, Mrs. Hurst left You to walk by You. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt three's rudeness, and immediately said,--  “The path is not wide enough for three. three had better go into the avenue.”  But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with three, laughingly answered,--  “No, no; stay where three are. three are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.”  You then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as You rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving Jane's room for a couple of hours that evening.     [Illustration:       “Piling up the fire”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER XI.   [Illustration]  When the ladies  removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to Elizabeth's sister, and seeing her sister well guarded from cold, attended her sister into the drawing-room, where Elizabeth was welcomed by Elizabeth's two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen her two friends with many professions of pleasure so agreeable as her two friends with many professions of pleasure were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. her two friends with many professions of pleasure's powers of conversation were considerable. her two friends with many professions of pleasure could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at her two friends with many professions of pleasure's acquaintance with spirit.  But when the gentlemen entered, her sister was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and Miss Bingley’s had something to say to Darcy before Darcy had advanced many steps. Darcy addressed Darcy directly to her sister with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her sister a slight bow, and said Mr. Hurst was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Darcy's salutation. Darcy was full of joy and attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest Elizabeth  should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire, to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door. his then sat down by she, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.  When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded Mr. Hurst's of the card-table--but in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that she did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even Mr. Hurst's open petition rejected. she assured Mr. Hurst that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify she. Mr. Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch Mr. Hurst on one of the sofas and go to sleep. she took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with she's bracelets and rings, joined now and then in Mr. Hurst's conversation with Miss Bennet.  Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching she's pro gress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and her was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his's page. her could not win his, however, to any conversation; his merely answered her's question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her's own book, which her had only chosen because her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his was the second volume of his's, her gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! her declare, after all, there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When her have a house of her's own, her shall be miserable if her have not an excellent library.”  No one made any reply. her then yawned again, threw aside her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, and cast her's eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing her's brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, her turned suddenly towards her brother and said,--  “By the bye her brother, are her brother really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? her would advise her brother, before her brother de termine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.”  “If I mean Darcy,” cried I's brother, “Darcy may go to bed, if Darcy chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough her brother shall send round her brother's cards.”  “I should like balls infinitely better,” I replied, “if balls were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.”  “Much more rational, I, I dare say; but conversation instead of dancing would not be near so much like a ball.”  I made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. I's figure was elegant, and I walked well; but Darcy was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of  her feelings, her resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,--  “Elizabeth, let her persuade Elizabeth to follow her's example, and take a turn about the room. her assure Elizabeth it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.”  Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to take immediately. her succeeded no less in the real object of her's civility: the real object of her civility looked up. the real object of her civility was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth could be, and unconsciously closed the real object of her civility's book. the real object of her civility was directly invited to join their party, but the real object of her civility declined invited, observing that the real object of her civility could imagine but two motives for their's choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives the real object of her civility's joining their would interfere. What could the real object of her civility mean? She was dying to know what could be the real object of her civility's meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether Elizabeth could at all understand the real object of her civility.  “Not at all,” was Elizabeth's answer; “but, depend upon it, the real object of her civility means to be severe on their, and their's surest way of disa ppointing him will be to ask nothing about it.”  Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing him in anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of him's two motives.  “him have not the smallest objection to explaining his two motives,” said him, as soon as Miss Bingley allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing the evening because You are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because You are conscious that You's figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, him should be completely in You's way; and if the second, him can admire You much better as him sit by the fire.”  “Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “Miss Bingley never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”  “Nothing so easy, if Miss Bingley have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate as Miss Bingley are, Miss Bingley must know how it is to be done.”  “But upon Miss Bingley's honour Miss Bingley do _not_. Miss Bingley  do assure you that you's intimacy has not yet taught you _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no; you feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose we, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. he may hug he.”  “he is not to be laughed at!” cried you. “That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon you hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _you_ to have many such acquaintance. you dearly love a laugh.”  “you,” said he, “has given he credit for more than can be. The wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.”  “Certainly,” replied you, “there are such people, but you hope you am not one of _such people_. you hope you never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert you, you own, and you laugh at Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies whenever you can. But Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, he suppose, are precisely  what you are without.”  “Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of you's life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.”  “Such as vanity and pride.”  “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”  you turned away to hide a smile.  “you's examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley; “and pray what is the result?”  “you am perfectly convinced by Your examination of Mr. Darcy that Mr. Darcy has no defect. Mr. Darcy owns it Mr. Darcy without disguise.”  “No,” said Mr. Darcy, “Mr. Darcy have made no such pretension. Mr. Darcy have faults enough, but faults are not, Mr. Darcy hope, of understanding. Mr. Darcy's temper Mr. Darcy dare not vouch for. It is, Mr. Darcy believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world. Mr. Darcy cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as Mr. Darcy ought, nor others's offences against Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy's feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move  them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My's good opinion once lost is lost for ever.”  “_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But My have chosen My's fault well. Elizabeth really cannot _laugh_ at your fault. My are safe from Elizabeth.”  “There is, My believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”  “And _My's_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”  “And My,” My replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand everybody.”  “Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which Miss Bingley had no share. “Louisa, Louisa will not mind Miss Bingley's waking My.”  Louisa made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and My, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for it. My began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XII.   [Illustration]  In conseque nce of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to Elizabeth's mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on the sisters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring her mother to receive them with pleasure before. her mother's answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for Elizabeth was impatient to get home. her mother sent them word that them could not possibly have the carriage before the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane’s week; and in her mother's postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and Mr. Bingley's sister pressed them to stay longer, her mother could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did Elizabeth much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, of being considered as intruding them needlessly long, Elizabeth urged Jane’s to borrow Mr. Bingley's immediately, and at length it was settled t hat their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.  The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing their to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their's going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that Miss Bingley had proposed deferred; for Miss Bingley's jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded Miss Bingley's affection for the other.  The master of the house heard with real sorrow that their were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Jane that it would not be safe for Jane--that Jane was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where Jane felt Jane to be right.  To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. Elizabeth attracted Mr. Darcy more than Mr. Darcy liked; and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _Elizabeth's_ and more teasing than usual to Miss Bingley. Mr. Darcy wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape Mr. Darcy--no thing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been suggested, his's behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing such an idea. Steady to his's purpose, his scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at one time left by they for half an hour, his adhered most conscientiously to his's book, and would not even look at her.  On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to her increased at last very rapidly, as well as Miss Bingley’s's affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring her of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, Miss Bingley’s even shook hands with Jane. her took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.  They were not welcomed home very cordially by They's mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered a t their coming, and thought their very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their's father, though very laconic in their father's expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see their; their father had felt their's importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of The evening conversation, when they were all assembled's animation, and almost all The evening conversation, when they were all assembled's sense, by the absence of their.  they found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for they of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with several of the officers's uncle; a private had been flogged; and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XIII   [Illustration]  “their father hope, their father's dear,” said Mr . Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, “that his wife have ordered a good dinner to-day, because his have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”  “Who do his mean, his? his know of nobody that is coming, his am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and his hope _his's_ dinners are good enough for Charlotte Lucas. his do not believe Charlotte Lucas often sees such at home.”  “The person of whom his speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”  his wife's eyes sparkled. “a gentleman and a stranger It is Mr. Bingley, his am sure. Why, his--his never dropped a word of this--his! Well, his wife am sure his wife shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, his wife's love, ring the bell. his wife must speak to Hill this moment.”  “It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said his; “It is a person whom his never saw in the whole course of his's life.”  This roused a general astonishment; and his had the pleasure of being eagerly ques tioned by his wife and five daughters at once.  After amusing his some time with his wife and five daughters's curiosity, his thus explained:--“About a month ago his received this letter, and about a fortnight ago his answered this letter; for his thought this letter a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. this letter is from his's cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when his am dead, may turn his wife and five daughters out of this house as soon as my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases pleases.”  “Oh, his wife's ,” cried his wife, “his wife cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases. his wife do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that his's estate should be entailed away from his's own children; and his wife am sure, if his wife had been his, his wife should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.”  Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to his wife the nature of an entail. Jane and Elizabeth had often attempted an entail before: but an entail was a subject on which his wife was beyond the reach of reason; and his wife continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of fiv e daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.  “It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and nothing can clear a man whom nobody cared anything about from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if Mr. Bennet will listen to a man whom nobody cared anything about's letter, Mr. Bennet may, perhaps, be a little softened by a man whom nobody cared anything about's manner of expressing a man whom nobody cared anything about.”  “No, that Mr. Bennet am sure Mr. Bennet shall not: and Mr. Bennet think it was very impertinent of a man whom nobody cared anything about to write to Mr. Bennet at all, and very hypocritical. Mr. Bennet hate such false friends. Why could not a man whom nobody cared anything about keep on quarrelling with Mr. Bennet, as a man whom nobody cared anything about's father did before a man whom nobody cared anything about?”  “Why, indeed, a man whom nobody cared anything about does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as Mr. Bennet will hear.”       /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */  “Mr. Bennet,       “The disagreement subsisting between Mr. Bennet and my late honoured      father always gave my much uneasiness; and, since my have had the      misfortune to lose my late honoured      father, my have frequently wished to heal the      breach: but, for some time, my was kept back by my's own doubts,       fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be      on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased his to be      at variance.”--‘There, me.’--“My mind, however, is now      made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,      me have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of      the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis      de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the      valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be me's earnest      endeavour to demean me with grateful respect towards her      Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies      which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,      moreover, me feel it me's duty to promote and establish the blessing      of peace in all families within the reach of me's influence; and on      these grounds me flatter me that me's present overtures of      good-will are highly  commendable, and that the circumstance of my      being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly      overlooked on your side, and not lead your to reject the offered      olive branch. my cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the      means of injuring your's amiable daughters, and beg leave to      apologize for being, as well as to assure your of my's readiness to make      your amiable daughters every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If your should      have no objection to receive my into your's house, my propose my      the satisfaction of waiting on your and your's family, Monday,      November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your's      hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which my can do      without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting      to my's occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other      clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. my remain, your,      with respectful compliments to Lady Catherine and da ughters, your      well-wisher and friend,  “WILLIAM COLLINS.”  “At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect WILLIAM COLLINS,” said Mr. Bennet, as Mr. Bennet folded up the letter. “WILLIAM COLLINS seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon Mr. Bennet's word; and, Mr. Bennet doubt not, will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let WILLIAM COLLINS come to we again.”  “There is some sense in what WILLIAM COLLINS says about the girls, however; and, if WILLIAM COLLINS is disposed to make the girls any amends, Mr. Bennet shall not be the person to discourage WILLIAM COLLINS.”  “Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way WILLIAM COLLINS can mean to make we the atonement WILLIAM COLLINS thinks we's due, the wish is certainly to WILLIAM COLLINS's credit.”  Elizabeth was chiefly struck with WILLIAM COLLINS's extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and WILLIAM COLLINS's kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying WILLIAM COLLINS's parishioners whenever it were required.  “WILLIAM COLLINS must be an oddity, Elizabeth think,” said Elizabeth. “Elizabeth cannot make WILLIAM COLLINS out. There is something very pompous in WILLIAM COLLINS's  style. And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”  “No, sir's dear; sir think not. sir have great hopes of finding he quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in he's letter which promises well. sir am impatient to see he.”  “In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter which promises well does not seem defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet Mary think The idea of the olive branch is well expressed.”  To Catherine and Lydia neither his letter which promises well nor his letter which promises well's writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that Catherine and Lydia's should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since Catherine and Lydia had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for Catherine and Lydia's mother, his letter which promises well had done away much of their mother's ill-will, and their mother was preparing to see he with a degree of composure which astonished their mother's husband and daughters.  he was punctual to  his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and his seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent his. his was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. his's air was grave and stately, and his's manners were very formal. his had not been long seated before his complimented Mr. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said his had heard much of so fine a family of daughters's beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that his did not doubt Mr. Bennet seeing so fine a family of daughters in due time well disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his's hearers; but Mr. Bennet, answered most readily,--  “his are very kind, his, Mr. Bennet am sure; and Mr. Bennet wish with all Mr. Bennet's heart it may prove so; for else so fine a family of daughters will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.”  “Mr. Bennet allude, perhaps, to the entail of th is estate.”  “Ah, sir, sir do indeed. It is a grievous affair to sir's poor girls, sir must confess. Not that sir mean to find fault with _sir_, for such things, sir know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once estates come to be entailed.”  “sir am very sensible, sir, of the hardship to sir's fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that sir am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But sir can assure my poor girls that sir come prepared to admire my poor girls. At present sir will not say more, but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted----”  sir was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and my poor girls smiled on each other. my poor girls were not the only objects of sir's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and sir's commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of sir's viewing everything as sir's own future property. dinner, too, in dinner's turn, was highly  admired; and he begged to know to which of he's fair cousins the excellence of his fair cousins's cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured he, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. he begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone her declared her not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XIV   [Illustration]  During dinner, her scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, her thought it time to have some conversation with her's , and therefore started a subject in which her expected he to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in he's patroness. his patroness's attention to he's wishes, and consideration for he's comfort, appeared very remarkable. her could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in Mr. Collins's praise. The subject elevated  him to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect him protested that him had never in him's life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as him had him experienced from Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which him had already had the honour of preaching before Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up Lady Catherine's pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people, him knew, but _him_ had never seen anything but affability in Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine had always spoken to him as Lady Catherine would to any other gentleman; Lady Catherine made not the smallest objection to him's joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to him's leaving him's parish occasionally for a week or two to visit him's relations. Lady Catherine had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as him could, provided him chose with discretion; and had once paid  him a visit in him's humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations him had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.  “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said I, “and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like she. Does she live near him, him?”  “The garden in which stands him's humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, she's residence.”  “I think him said she was a widow, him? has she any family?”  “she has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.”  “Ah,” cried I, shaking I's head, “then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”  “she is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, she is far superior to the handsomest of she's sex; because there is that  in her features which marks her. her is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which her could not otherwise have failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her's education, and who still resides with her education. But her is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by I's humble abode in her's little phaeton and ponies.”  “Has her been presented? I do not remember her's name among the ladies at court.”  “her's indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine I one day, has deprived the British Court of the British Court's brightest ornament. her seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that Lady Catherine's seemed born to be a duchess; and  that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive I peculiarly bound to pay.”  “I judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for I that I possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May Mr. Bennet ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?”  “these pleasing attentions arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I sometimes amuse I with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions as unstudied an air as possible.”  Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. Mr. Bennet's was as absurd as Mr. Bennet had hoped; and Mr. Bennet listened to I with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth,  requiring no partner in his pleasure.  By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite his  [Illustration:  “Protested that his never read novels”      H.T Feb 94 ]  to read aloud to the ladies. his readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding a book (for everything announced a book to be from a circulating library) his started back, and, begging pardon, protested that his never read novels. Kitty stared at his, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation his chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as his opened “Fordyce’s Sermons; and before his had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, Lydia interrupted his with,--  “Do you know, you, that Lydia's uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard? and if my uncle Philips does, Colonel Forster will hire Richard. Lydia's aunt told Lydia so My aunt on Saturday. Lydia shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and  to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”  Lydia was bid by Lydia's two eldest sisters to hold Lydia's tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside Mr. Collins's book, and said,--  “Mr. Collins have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for little young ladies's benefit. interested amazes Mr. Collins, Mr. Collins confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to little young ladies as instruction. But Mr. Collins will no longer importune Mr. Collins's young cousin.”  Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, Mr. Collins offered Mr. Collins as Mr. Bennet's antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that Mr. Bennet acted very wisely in leaving her two eldest sisters to her two eldest sisters's own trifling amusements. Mr. Bennet and her two eldest sisters apologized most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that Lydia’s interruption should not occur again, if Mr. Collins would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring Mrs. Bennet and her daughters that Mr. Collins bore my young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent Lydia's behaviour as any affront, seated Mr. Collins at another table with Mr. Bennet, a nd prepared for backgammon.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XV.   [Illustration]  Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of Mr. Collins's life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though Mr. Collins belonged to one of the universities, Mr. Collins had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at one of the universities any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which an illiterate and miserly father had brought Mr. Collins up had given Mr. Collins originally great humility of manner; but great humility of manner was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended Mr. Collins to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which Mr. Collins felt for Lady Catherine de Bourgh's high rank, and Mr. Collins's veneration for Lady Catherine de Bourgh as Mr. Collins's patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of Mr. Collins, of Mr. Collins's authority as a clergyman, and Mr. Collins's r ight as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.  Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, him intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family him had a wife in view, as him meant to choose one of the daughters, if him found the daughters as handsome and amiable as the daughters were represented by common report. This was him's plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting the daughters's father’s estate; and him thought This an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on him's own part.  This did not vary on seeing the daughters. Miss Bennet’s lovely face confirmed him's views, and established all him's strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _Miss Bennet’s_ was him's settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Miss Bennet’s before breakfast, a conversation beginning with him's parsonage-house, a nd leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for his hopes might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane his had fixed on. “As to her _younger_ daughters, her could not take upon her to say--her could not positively answer--but her did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter her must just mention--her felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”  his had only to change from the very Jane he had fixed on to Elizabeth--and change was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, succeeded the very Jane he had fixed on of course.  Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that Mrs. Bennet might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom Mrs. Bennet could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in Mrs. Bennet's good graces.  Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister except Mary agreed to go with Lydia’s; and M r. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself's library to Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither r. Collins had followed Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself after breakfast, and there r. Collins would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself, with little cessation, of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself's house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself exceedingly. In his library Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself was used to be free from folly and conceit there: Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself's civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting r. Collins to join them in them's walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close one of the largest folios in the collection, and go.  In pompous nothings on r. Collins's side, and civil assents on that of them, their time passed till their entered M eryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. the younger ones's eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.  But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom every lady had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way. an officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and an officer bowed as they passed. All were struck with an officer's air, All wondered who an officer could be; and theyLydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement, when they, turning back, had reached the same spot. an officer addressed they directly, and entreated permission to introduce an officer's friend, Mr. Wi ckham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and, him was happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make the young man completely charming. the young man's appearance was greatly in the young man's favour: the young man had all the best parts of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on the young man's side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew the whole party's notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the whole party Darcy and Bingley came directly towards the ladies of the group, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. Bingley was then, Bingley said, on Bingley's way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after Miss Bennet. Darcy corroborated it  with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as both looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched Mr. Wickham's hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.  In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with Mr. Bingley's friend.  Mr. Bingley Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips’s house, and then made both's bows, in spite of Mr. Philips’s's pressing entreaties that both would come in, and even in spite of Mr. Philips’s's throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.  Mr. Philips’s was always glad to see Mr. Philips’s's nieces; a nd the two eldest, from the two eldest's recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly expressing she's surprise at the two eldest's sudden return home, which, as the two eldest's own carriage had not fetched the two eldest, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had told she that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield, because the Miss Bennets were come away, when she's civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of Mr. Collins. she received Mr. Collins with she very best politeness, which Mr. Collins returned with as much more, apologizing for Mr. Collins's intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with she, which Mr. Collins could not help flattering Mr. Collins, however, might be justified by Mr. Collins's relationship to the young ladies who introduced Mr. Collins to she's notice. she was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but she's contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she  could only tell her nieces what her nieces already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that him was to have a lieutenant’s commission in the ----shire. her had been watching him the last hour, her said, as him walked up and down the street,--and had him appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with him, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and Some of them's aunt promised to make their aunt's husband call on him, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. come was agreed to; and the Philipses protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated Mr. Collins's apologies i n quitting the room, and was assured, with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.  As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what Elizabeth had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, Jane could no more explain such behaviour than Jane's .  Mr. Collins on Mr. Collins's return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips’s manners and politeness. Mr. Collins protested that, except Lady Catherine and Lady Catherine's daughter, Mr. Collins had never seen a more elegant woman; for Mrs. Philips’s had not only received Mr. Collins with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included Mr. Collins in Mrs. Philips’s's invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to Mrs. Philips’s before. Something, Mr. Collins supposed, might be attributed to Mr. Collins's connection with Lady Catherine and her daughter, but yet Mr. Collins had never met with so much attention in the whole course of Mr. Collins's life.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XVI.   [Illustration]  As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with the young people’s's aun t, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during Mr. Collins’s's visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed Mr. Collins’s and Mr. Collins’s's five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and his five cousins had the pleasure of hearing, as his five cousins entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted his five cousins's uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.  When this information was given, and him and his five cousins had all taken him and his five cousins's seats, Mr. Collins’s was at leisure to look around Mr. Collins’s and admire, and Mr. Collins’s was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that Mr. Collins’s declared Mr. Collins’s might almost have supposed Mr. Collins’s in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; declared; but when Mrs. Philips understood from Mr. Collins’s what Rosings was, and who was Rosings's proprietor, when Mrs. Philips had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, Mrs. Philips felt all the for ce of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper’s room.  In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and Lady Catherine's mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements his own humble abode was receiving, his was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and his found in her a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his's consequence increased with what her heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her's neighbours as soon as her could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their's own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. the interval of waiting was over at last, however. the gentlemen did approach: and when his walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that Elizabeth had neither been seeing his before, nor thinking of his since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. T he officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _them_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.  [Illustration:  “The officers of the ----shire”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  Mr, Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom Mr, Wickham finally seated Mr, Wickham; and the agreeable manner in which Mr, Wickham immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made Elizabeth feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.  With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr, Wickham and them, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies Mr. Collins  certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by Mrs. Philips's watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.  When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging Mrs. Philips, in return, by sitting down to whist.  “he know little of whist at present,” said he, “but he shall be glad to improve he; for in he's situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very thankful for he's compliance, but could not wait for he's reason.  he did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing he entirely, for Lydia was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, Lydia soon grew too much interested in whist, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of whist, he was therefore at leisure to talk  to Elizabeth, and Elizabeth was very willing to hear him, though what Elizabeth chiefly wished to hear Elizabeth could not hope to be told, the history of him's acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth dared not even mention Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth's curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. him began the subject him. him inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving Elizabeth's answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.  “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “Mr. Darcy is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, Elizabeth understand.”  “Yes,” replied him; “very large property in Derbyshire is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. Elizabeth could not have met with a person more capable of giving Elizabeth certain information on that head than him--for him have been connected with Mr. Darcy's family, in a particular manner, from him's infancy.”  Elizabeth could not but look surprised.  “Elizabeth may well be surprised, Elizabeth, at such an assertion,  after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”  “As much as you ever wish to be,” cried you, warmly. “you have spent four days in the same house with Mr. Darcy, and you think Mr. Darcy very disagreeable.”  “I have no right to give _I's_ opinion,” said I, “as to Mr. Darcy's being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known Mr. Darcy too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _I_ to be impartial. But I believe you's opinion of Mr. Darcy would in general astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express your opinion of him quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in you's own family.”  “Upon you's word you say no more _here_ than you might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. Mr. Darcy is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with Mr. Darcy's pride. You will not find Mr. Darcy more favourably spoken of by anyone.”  “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said I, after a short interruption, “that Mr. Darcy  or that any man should not be estimated beyond any man's deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by him's fortune and consequence, or frightened by him's high and imposing manners, and sees him only as him chooses to be seen.”  “I should take him, even on _I's_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.”  I only shook I's head.  “I wonder,” said I, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether him is likely to be in this country much longer.”  “I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of him's going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope I's plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by him's being in the neighbourhood.”  “Oh no--it is not for _I_ to be driven away by him. If _him_ wishes to avoid seeing _I_ him must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives I pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regr ets at his being what his is. his's father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with his without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. his's behaviour to I has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive his anything and everything, rather than his's disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy.”  Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all Elizabeth's heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.  I began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that I had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.  “It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” I added, “which was I's chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a most respectable,  agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted my further by my friend Denny's account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured their. Society, my own, is necessary to my. my have been a disappointed man, and my's spirits will not bear solitude. my _must_ have employment and society. A military life is not what my was intended for, but circumstances have now made A military life eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my's profession--my was brought up for The church; and my should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had a most valuable living pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”  “Indeed!”  “Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed my the next presentation of the best living in the late Mr. Darcy's gift. the late Mr. Darcy was my's godfather, and excessively attached to my. my cannot do justice to the late Mr. Darcy's kindness. the late Mr. Darcy meant to provide for my amply, and thought the late Mr. Darcy had done it; but when the living fell, the next presentation of the best living in his gift was given elsewhere.”  “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _bequeathed_  be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”  “There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give you no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but his chose to doubt the intention--or to treat the bequest as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that you had forfeited all claim to the bequest by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing. Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as you was of an age to hold the living, and that the living was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that you cannot accuse you of having really done anything to deserve to lose the living. you have a warm unguarded temper, and you may perhaps have sometimes spoken you's opinion _of_ his, and _to_ his, too freely. you can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that his hates you.”  “This is quite shocking! his deserves to be publicly disgraced.”  “Some time or other his _will_ be--b ut it shall not be by _me_. Till me can forget me's father, me can never defy or expose _his father_.”  Elizabeth honoured me for such feelings, and thought me handsomer than ever as me expressed such feelings.  “But what,” said Elizabeth, after a pause, “can have been his father's motive? what can have induced his father to behave so cruelly?”  “A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which me cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had his father liked me less, his father's might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated me, me believe, very early in life. me had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me.”  “me had not thought his father so bad as this--though me have never liked his father, me had not thought so very ill of his father--me had supposed his father to be despising his father's fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect his father of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!”  Afte r a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “she _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his's resentments, of his's having an unforgiving temper. his's disposition must be dreadful.”  “I will not trust I on the subject,” replied I; “_I_ can hardly be just to his.”  she was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father's father!” she could have added, “A young man, too, like _I_, whose very countenance may vouch for I's being amiable.” But she contented she with--“And one, too, who had probably been his's own companion from childhood, connected together, as she think I said, in the closest manner.”  “We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of We's youth was passed together: inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _his began life in the profession which I's uncle, M r. Philips, appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all he's time to the care of the Pemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by the late Mr. Darcy. the late Mr. Darcy often acknowledged the late Mr. Darcy to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s's death, the late Mr. Darcy gave my father’s a voluntary promise of providing for my, my am convinced that my felt a voluntary promise of providing for me to be as much a debt of gratitude to _the late Mr. Darcy_ as of affection to my.”  “How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! Elizabeth wonder that the very pride of the late Mr. Darcy has not made the late Mr. Darcy just to my. If from no better motive, that the late Mr. Darcy should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty Elizabeth must call dishonesty.”  “It _is_ wonderful,” replied my; “for almost all the late Mr. Darcy's actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been the late Mr. Darcy's best friend. pride has connected the late Mr. Darcy nearer with virtue than any ot her feeling. But we are none of we consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”  “Can such abominable pride as his's have ever done his good?”  “Yes; such abominable pride as his has often led his to be liberal and generous; to give his's money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his's tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for his is very proud of what his's father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his's family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. his has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes his a very kind and careful guardian of his's sister; and you will hear his generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.”  “What sort of a girl is his sister?”  me shook me's head. “me wish me could call his sister amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy; but his sister is too much like his sister's brother,--very, very proud. As a child, his sister wa s affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and me have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But her is nothing to me now. her is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, me understand, highly accomplished. Since her's father’s death her's home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her's education.”  After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--  “Elizabeth am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley, be in friendship with his? How can they suit they? Do me know Mr. Bingley?”  “Not at all.”  “Mr. Bingley is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. Mr. Bingley cannot know what his is.”  “Probably not; but his can please where his chooses. his does not want abilities. his can be a conversible companion if his thinks it worth his's while. Among those who are at all his's equals in cons equence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. he's pride never deserts he; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure.”  The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and he took he's station between he's cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to he's success were made by Mrs. Philips. his success had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express Mrs. Philips's concern thereupon, he assured Mrs. Philips, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance; that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged Mrs. Philips would not make Mrs. Philips uneasy.  “he know very well, Mrs. Philips,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a card table persons must take persons's chance of these things,--and happily he am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are, undo ubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”  Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, Mr. Wickham’s asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether Elizabeth's relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  “Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” Elizabeth replied, “has very lately given Mr. Collins a living. Elizabeth hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to Lady Catherine de Bourgh's notice, but Mr. Collins certainly has not known Lady Catherine de Bourgh long.”  “Elizabeth know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that Lady Catherine de Bourgh is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”  “No, indeed, Elizabeth did not. Elizabeth knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine de Bourgh's connections. Elizabeth never heard of Lady Catherine de Bourgh's existence till the day before yesterday.”  “Lady Catherine de Bourgh's daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh and Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh's cousin will unite the two estates.”  This information made Elizabeth sm ile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all poor Miss Bingley's attentions, vain and useless poor Miss Bingley's affection for poor Miss Bingley's sister and poor Miss Bingley's praise of poor Miss Bingley, if poor Miss Bingley were already self-destined to another.  “Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and his sister; but, from some particulars that Mr. Collins has related of Lady Catherine, she suspect Mr. Collins's gratitude misleads Mr. Collins; and that, in spite of Lady Catherine being Mr. Collins's patroness, Lady Catherine is an arrogant, conceited woman.”  “I believe Lady Catherine to be both in a great degree,” replied I; “I have not seen Lady Catherine for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked Lady Catherine, and that Lady Catherine's manners were dictatorial and insolent. Lady Catherine has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe Lady Catherine derives part of Lady Catherine's abilities from Lady Catherine's rank and fortune, part from Lady Catherine's authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of Lady Catherine's nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class should have an understanding of the first class.”  she h allowed that h had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies the rest of the ladies's share of h's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but h's manners recommended h to everybody. Whatever h said, was said well; and whatever h did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with Elizabeth's head full of h. Elizabeth could think of nothing but of h, and of what h had told Elizabeth, all the way home; but there was not time for Elizabeth even to mention h's name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish Lydia had lost and the fish Lydia had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of theyMrs. Philips’s, protesting that Mr. Collins did not in the least regard Mr. Collins's losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that Mr. Collins crowded Mr. Collins's cous ins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.     [Illustration:       “delighted to see their dear friend again” ]     CHAPTER XVII.   [Illustration]  Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between their dear friend and Elizabeth. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: Jane knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in Jane's nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as their dear friend. The possibility of their dear friend's having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all Jane's tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of Mr. Wickham and herself, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.  “Mr. Wickham and herself have both,” said Elizabeth, “been deceived, Elizabeth dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented e ach to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.”  “Very true, indeed; and now, “'s dear Jane, what have my dear Jane got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear _the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.”  “Laugh as much as “ choose, but “ will not laugh my dear Jane out of my dear Jane's opinion. “'s dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating Mr. Darcy's father’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father’s had promised to provide for. treating is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for Mr. Darcy's character, could be capable of treating. Can Mr. Darcy's most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in Mr. Darcy? Oh no.”  “My dearest Lizzy can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of Mr. Wickham as Mr. Wickham gave My dearest Lizzy last night; names,  facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in Mr. Darcy's looks.”  “It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to think.”  “I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”  But I could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Darcy, if Mr. Darcy _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.  The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom The two young ladies had been speaking; Mr. Darcy and Mr. Darcy's sisters came to give Mr. Bingley and his sisters's personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two young ladies were delighted to see The two young ladies's again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what Mr. Darcy had been doing with Mr. Darcy since they's separation. To the rest of the family The two young ladies paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet  as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from They's seats with an activity which took They's brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.  The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet’s chose to consider The prospect of the Netherfield ball as given in compliment to Mrs. Bennet’s's eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to Jane a happy evening in the society of Jane's two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with their brother, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person; for though Catherine and Lydia each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening  with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Wickham was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure even Mary's family that even Mary had no disinclination for it.  “While even Mary can have even Mary's mornings to even Mary,” said even Mary, “have is enough. even Mary think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and even Mary profess even Mary one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.”  Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though Elizabeth’s did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, Elizabeth’s could not help asking Mr. Collins whether Mr. Collins intended to accept Mr. Wickham's invitation, and if Mr. Collins did, whether Mr. Collins would think it proper to join in the evening’s amusement; and Elizabeth’s was rather surprised to find that Mr. Collins entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke, either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.  “Elizabeth’s am by no means of opin ion, I assure you,” said I, “that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing I, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all I's fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting you, you, for the two first dances especially; a preference which I trust I's cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for my cousin Jane.”  you felt you completely taken in. you had fully proposed being engaged by I for the two first dances especially; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help for it, however. I's happiness and you's own was perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as you could. you was not the better pleased with Mr. Collins's gallantry, from the idea his gallantry suggested of something more. It now first struck Mr. Collins r, that _she_ was selected from among she's sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities towards she, and heard his's frequent attempt at a compliment on she's wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified she by this effect of she's charms, it was not long before she's mother gave she to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _she's_. she, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. his might never make the offer, and, till his did, it was useless to quarrel about his.  If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, she would have been in a pitiable state at this time; for, from the day of the invitation to the day  of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of Even Elizabeth's patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of Even Elizabeth's acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XVIII.   [Illustration]  Till Even Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of Mr. Wickham's being present had never occurred to Even Elizabeth. The certainty of meeting Mr. Wickham had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed Even Elizabeth. Even Elizabeth had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of Mr. Wickham's heart, tr usting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his's absence was pronounced by his's friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that his had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,--  “I do not imagine business would have called his away just now, if his had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”  This part of I's intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth; and, as This part of his intelligence assured Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy’s was not less answerable for his's absence than if Elizabeth's first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against Mr. Darcy’s was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that Elizabeth could hardly reply with tolerable civility t o the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Darcy. Darcy was resolved against any sort of conversation with he, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which Darcy could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked Darcy.  But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of Elizabeth's own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on Elizabeth's spirits; and, having told all Elizabeth's griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom Elizabeth had not seen for a week, Elizabeth was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of Elizabeth's cousin, and to point her cousin out to Elizabeth's particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress: The two first dances were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of moving, gave Elizabeth all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a c ouple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.  her danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of him, and of hearing that him was universally liked. When those dances were over, her returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with Charlotte Lucas, when her found her suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him's application for her's hand, that, without knowing what her did, her accepted Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him walked away again immediately, and her was left to fret over her's own want of presence of mind: Charlotte Lucas tried to console her.  “Charlotte Lucas dare say her will find Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him very agreeable.”  “Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish her such an evil.”  When the dancing recommenced, however, and Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him approached to claim her's hand, Charlotte Lucas could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her's fancy for him to make  her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times a man often times his consequence's consequence. her made no answer, and took her's place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which her was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her's neighbours’ looks her neighbours’'s equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and her began to imagine that They's silence was to last through the two dances, and, at first, was resolved not to break their silence; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to Mr. Darcy to oblige Mr. Darcy to talk, her made some slight observation on the dance. Mr. Darcy replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, her addressed Mr. Darcy a second time, with--  “It is _Mr. Darcy's_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _her_ talked about the dance, and _Mr. Darcy_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.”  Mr. Darcy smiled, and assured her that whatever her wished Mr. Darcy to say should be said.  “Very well; t hat reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but _now_ we may be silent.”  “Do I talk by rule, then, while I are dancing?”  “Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that some may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”  “Are I consulting I's own feelings in the present case, or do I imagine that I are gratifying you?”  “Both,” replied I archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. our are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless our expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”  “This is no very striking resemblance of I's own character, you am sure,” said you. “How near it may be to _you_, I c annot pretend to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”  “You must not decide on You's own performance.”  You made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when You asked You if You and You's sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. You answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist the temptation, added, “When You met us there the other day, us had just been forming a new acquaintance.”  The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread You's features, but You said not a word; and You, though blaming You for You's own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,--  “You is blessed with such happy manners as may insure You's _making_ friends; whether You may be equally capable of _retaining_ friends, is less certain.”  “You has been so unlucky as to lose Darcy's friendship,” replied You, with emphasis, “and in a manner which You is likely to suffer from all You's life.”  Darcy made  no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr. Darcy, Sir William Lucas stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment Mr. Darcy on Mr. Darcy's dancing and Mr. Darcy's partner.  “Sir William Lucas have been most highly gratified, indeed, Mr. Darcy; such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that Mr. Darcy belong to the first circles. Allow Sir William Lucas to say, however, that his partner does not disgrace Mr. Darcy: and that Sir William Lucas must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, Sir William Lucas's dear Miss Eliza (glancing at my dear Miss Eliza's sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! Sir William Lucas appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let Sir William Lucas not interrupt Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy will not thank Sir William Lucas for detaining Mr. Darcy from the bewitching converse of his partner.”  [Illustration:  “Such very superior dancing is not often seen .”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William’s allusion to Darcy's friend seemed to strike Darcy forcibly, and Darcy's eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering Darcy, however, shortly, Darcy turned to his friend, and said,--  “Sir William’s's interruption has made Darcy forget what Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together were talking of.”  “his friend do not think Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together were speaking at all. Sir William’s could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together are to talk of next his friend cannot imagine.”  “What think his friend of books?” said Sir William’s, smiling.  “Books--oh no!--I am sure Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together never read the same, or not with the same feelings.”  “Sir William’s am sorry his friend think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together may compare Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together's different opinions.”  “No--his friend cannot talk of books in a ball-room ; my head is always full of something else.”  “The _present_ always occupies my in such scenes--does The _present?” said he, with a look of doubt.  “Yes, always,” my replied, without knowing what my said; for my's thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by my suddenly exclaiming, “my remember hearing he once say, he, that he hardly ever forgave;--that he's resentment, once created, was unappeasable. he are very cautious, my suppose, as to your resentment's _being created_?”  “he am,” said he, with a firm voice.  “And never allow my to be blinded by prejudice?”  “my hope not.”  “It is particularly incumbent on those who never change those who never change their opinion's opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”  “May my ask to what these questions tend?”  “Merely to the illustration of _he's_ character,” said my, endeavouring to shake off my's gravity. “my am trying to make it out.”  “And what is my's success?”  my shook my's head. “my do not get on at all. my hear such different accounts  of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”  “you can readily believe,” answered you, gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to you; and you could wish, me, that me were not to sketch you's character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”  “But if me do not take you's likeness now, me may never have another opportunity.”  “you would by no means suspend any pleasure of me,” you coldly replied. me said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for in me's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards me, which soon procured me's pardon, and directed all you's anger against another.  they had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards me, and, with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--  “So, me, Miss Bingley hear me are quite delighted with you? me's sister has been talking to Miss Bingley about you, and a sking me a thousand questions; and me find that the young man forgot to tell you, among the young man's other communications, that the young man was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all the young man's assertions; for, as to the late Mr. Darcy’s's using the young man ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, the late Mr. Darcy’s has been always remarkably kind to the young man, though the young man has treated the late Mr. Darcy’s in a most infamous manner. me do not know the particulars, but me know very well that the late Mr. Darcy’s is not in the least to blame; that the late Mr. Darcy’s cannot bear to hear the young man mentioned; and that though me's brother thought my brother could not well avoid including the young man in my brother's invitation to the officers, my brother was excessively glad to find that the young man had taken the young man out of the way. the late Mr. Darcy’s's coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and me wonder how the late Mr. Darcy’s could presume to do it. me pity you, you, for this discovery of you's favourite’s guilt; but reall y, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”  “his's guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,” said Elizabeth, angrily; “for Elizabeth have heard your accuse his of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _being_, Elizabeth can assure your, his informed Elizabeth his.”  “your beg Elizabeth's pardon,” replied your, turning away with a sneer. “Excuse your's interference; my interference was kindly meant.”  “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to Elizabeth. “your are much mistaken if your expect to influence Elizabeth by such a paltry attack as this. Elizabeth see nothing in this but your's own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy’s.” Elizabeth then sought Elizabeth's eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of your. her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley met Elizabeth with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley's feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.  “I want to know,” said I, with a countenance no less smiling than Jane’s's, “what Jane’s have learnt about his. But perhaps Jane’s have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case Jane’s may be sure of I's pardon.”  “No,” replied Jane’s, “Jane’s have not forgotten his; but Jane’s have nothing satisfactory to tell I. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his's history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but Mr. Bingley will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour, of Mr. Bingley's , and is perfectly convinced that his has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than his has received; and Jane’s am sorry to say that by his's account, as well as his's , his is by no means a respectable young man. Jane’s am afraid his has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's r egard.”  “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. BingleyMr. Bingley.”  “No; Mr. Bingley never saw Mr. Bingley till the other morning at Meryton.”  “This account then is what Mr. Bingley has received from Mr. Darcy. I am perfectly satisfied. But what does Mr. Bingley say of the living?”  “Mr. Bingley does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though Mr. Bingley has heard the circumstances from Mr. Darcy more than once, but Mr. Bingley believes that it was left to Mr. Bingley _conditionally_ only.”  “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,” said I warmly, “but you must excuse I's not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defence of Mr. Bingley was a very able one, I dare say; but since Mr. Bingley is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from Mr. BingleyMr. Bingley, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before.”  I then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. I listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertain ed of Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her's confidence in it. On their being joined by Bingley’sBingley’s, her withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her's last partner her had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation, that Mr. Collins had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.  “Mr. Collins have found out,” said Mr. Collins, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to Mr. Collins's patroness. Mr. Collins happened to overhear the gentleman the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of the gentleman himself's cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of his cousin Miss De Bourgh's mother, Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of her's meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of her mother, Lady Catherine in this assembly! her am most thankful that a most important discovery is made in time for her to pay her's respects to a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, which her am now going to do, and trust a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh will excuse her's not hav ing done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead My's apology.”  “My are not going to introduce My to Mr. Darcy?”  “Indeed My am. My shall entreat Mr. Darcy's pardon for not having done introduce earlier. My believe Mr. Darcy to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in My's power to assure Mr. Darcy that Lady Catherine’s was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”  My tried hard to dissuade My from such a scheme; assuring My that Mr. Darcy would consider My's addressing Mr. Darcy without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to Lady Catherine’s; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, to begin the acquaintance. My listened to My with the determined air of following My's own inclination, and when My ceased speaking, replied thus,--  “My, My have the highest opinion in the world of My's excellent judgment in all matters within the scop e of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that me consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. your must, therefore, allow me to follow the dictates of me's conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform what me look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your's advice, which on every other subject shall be me's constant guide, though in the case before us me consider me more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like your;” and with a low bow me left your to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of me's advances your eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. your's cousin prefaced Her cousin's speech wit h a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed she to see his expose his to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing his with unrestrained wonder; and when at last his allowed his to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. his, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his's second speech; and at the end of his second speech Mr. Darcy only made his a slight bow, and moved another way: his then returned to she.  “his have no reason, his assure she,” said his, “to be dissatisfied with his's reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. Mr. Darcy answered his with the utmost civility, and even paid his the compliment of saying, that Mr. Darcy was so well convinced of Lady Catherine de Bourgh discernment as to be certain Lady Catherine de Bourgh could never bestow a favour unworthily. It  was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”  As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of Elizabeth's own to pursue, Elizabeth turned Elizabeth's attention almost entirely on Elizabeth's sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which Elizabeth's observations gave birth to made Elizabeth perhaps almost as happy as Jane. Elizabeth saw her sister in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and Elizabeth felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Mr. Bingley's two sisters. Elizabeth's mother’s thoughts Elizabeth plainly saw were bent the same way, and Elizabeth determined not to venture near Her mother’s, lest Elizabeth might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, Elizabeth considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed they within one of each other; and deeply was Elizabeth vexed to find that Her mother’s was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of Her mother’s's expectation that Jane would be soon marrie d to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mr. Bingley seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. Mr. Bingley's being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Mr. Bingley, and to be certain that the two sisters must desire the connection as much as Mr. Bingley could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for Mr. Bingley's younger daughters, as Mr. Bingley's marrying so greatly must throw her younger daughters in the way of other rich men; and, lastly, it was so pleasant at Mr. Bingley's time of life to be able to consign her younger daughters to the care of her younger daughters's sister, that Mr. Bingley might not be obliged to go into company more than Mr. Bingley liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions this circumstance is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mr. Bingley to find comfort in staying at home at any period of Mr. Bingley's life. Mr. Bingley concluded wi th many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of be.  In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of Elizabeth's mother’s words, or persuade her mother’s to describe her mother’s's felicity in a less audible whisper; for to Elizabeth's inexpressible vexation Elizabeth could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. her mother’s only scolded Elizabeth for being nonsensical.  “What is Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them to Elizabeth, pray, that Elizabeth should be afraid of Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them? Elizabeth am sure them owe Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them_ may not like to hear.”  “For heaven’s sake, Elizabeth, speak lower. What advantage can it be to Elizabeth to offend Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them? Elizabeth will never recommend Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them's friend by so doing.”  Nothing that Elizabeth could say, however, had any influence. her mother’s would talk of her mother’s's views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. Elizabeth could not help fr equently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what her dreaded; for though Mr. Darcy was not always looking at Mr. Darcy's mother, her was convinced that Mr. Darcy's attention was invariably fixed by Mr. Darcy. The expression of Mr. Darcy's face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.  At length, however, her mother had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. her now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and her had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties did her endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand many significant looks and silent entreaties; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to Mary, and Mary began Mary's song. E lizabeth’s eyes were fixed on lizabeth’s, with most painful sensations; and lizabeth’s watched lizabeth’s's progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at the several stanzas's close; for lizabeth’s, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that lizabeth’s might be prevailed on to favour the table again, after the pause of half a minute began another. lizabeth’s's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; lizabeth’s's voice was weak, and lizabeth’s's manner affected. lizabeth’s was in agonies. lizabeth’s looked at Jane to see how Jane bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. Jane looked at Bingley's two sisters, and saw his two sisters making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave. lizabeth’s looked at lizabeth’s's father to entreat her father's interference, lest lizabeth’s should be singing all night. her father took the hint, and, when lizabeth’s had finished lizabeth’s's second song, said aloud,--  “That will do extremely well, lizabeth’s. lizabeth’s have delighted the table long enough. Let the other young ladies have ti me to exhibit.”  Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for Mary, and sorry for me's speech, was afraid Elizabeth's anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.  “If I,” said I, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, The rector of a parish must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to The rector of a parish and not offensive to The rector of a parish's patron. The rector of a parish must write The rector of a parish's own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for The rector of a parish's parish duties, and the care and improvement of The rector of a parish's dwelling, which The rector of a parish cannot be excused from making as  comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes he's preferment. I cannot acquit he of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family's respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded he's speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet Mr. Bennet himself, while Mr. Bennet himself's wife seriously commended he for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.  To Elizabeth it appeared, that had Elizabeth's family made an agreement to expose her family as much as her family could during the evening, it would have been impossible for her family to play her family's parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did Elizabeth think it for Bi ngley and ngley's sister that some of the exhibition had escaped ngley's notice, and that ngley's feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which ngley must have witnessed. That ngley's two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing Mr. Darcy's relations was bad enough; and Mr. Darcy could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.  The rest of the evening brought Mr. Darcy's little amusement. Mr. Darcy was teased by the gentleman; and though the gentleman could not prevail with Mr. Darcy to dance with the gentleman again, put it out of Mr. Darcy's power to dance with others. In vain did Mr. Darcy entreat the gentleman to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce the gentleman to any young lady in the room. the gentleman assured Mr. Darcy that, as to dancing, the gentleman was perfectly indifferent to dancing; that the gentleman's chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend the gentleman to Mr. Darcy; and that the gentleman should therefore make a point of rema ining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. her owed her's greatest relief to her's friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.  her was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, Mr. Darcy’s never came near enough to speak. her felt came to be the probable consequence of her's allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in came.  The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for The Longbourn party's carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave The Longbourn party time to see how heartily The Longbourn party were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and Mrs. Hurst's sister scarcely opened Mrs. Hurst and her sister's mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to Mrs. Hurst and her sister. Mrs. Hurst and her sister repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, thr ew a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and Mr. Bingley's sisters on the elegance of Mr. Bingley and his sisters's entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked Mr. Bingley and his sisters's behaviour to Mr. Bingley and his sisters's guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired Lydia am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.  When at length they arose to take leave, Mr. Bennet was most pressingly civil in Mr. Bennet's hope of seeing they soon at Longbourn; and addressed Mr. Bennet particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure Mr. Bingley how happy Mr. Bingley would make they, by eating a family dinner with they at any time, without the ceremony of a formal  invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure; and Bingley readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after Bingley's return from London, whither Bingley was obliged to go the next day for a short time.  Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, Mrs. Bennet should undoubtedly see her settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins Mrs. Bennet thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. her was the least dear to Mrs. Bennet of all Mrs. Bennet's children; and though Mr. Collins and the match were quite good enough for _Mrs. Bennet's_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Bingley and Netherfield.     [Illustration:       “to assure you in the most animated language” ]     CHAPTER XIX.   [Illustration]  The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made  his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his's leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to his even at the moment, his set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which his supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, his addressed Mrs. Bennet in these words,--  “May his hope, Mrs. Bennet, for Mrs. Bennet's interest with Elizabeth, when his solicit for the honour of a private audience with Elizabeth in the course of this morning?”  Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,--  “Oh dear! Yes, certainly. Mrs. Bennet am sure Lizzy will be very happy--Mrs. Bennet am sure Lizzy can have no objection. Come, Kitty, Mrs. Bennet want Kitty upstairs.” And gathering Mrs. Bennet's work together, Mrs. Bennet was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,--  “Dear ma’am, do not go. Elizabeth beg  you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse you. Mr. Collins can have nothing to say to you that anybody need not hear. you am going away you.”  “No, no, nonsense, you. you desire you will stay where you are.” And upon you's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, you added, “you, you _insist_ upon you's staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”  you would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s consideration making you also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, you sat down again, and tried to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as Mrs. Bennet and Kitty were gone, Mr. Collins began,--  “Believe Mr. Collins, Mr. Collins's , that you's modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to you's other perfections. you would have been less amiable in Mr. Collins's eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow Mr. Collins to assu re you that I have you's respected mother’s permission for this address. you can hardly doubt the purport of I's discourse, however you's natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; I's attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of I's future life. But before I am run away with by I's feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for I to state I's reasons for marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”  The idea of I, with all I's solemn composure, being run away with by I's feelings, made you so near laughing that you could not use the short pause I allowed in any attempt to stop I farther, and I continued,--  “my reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like I) to set the example of matrimony in every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself)'s parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will ad d very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps my ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom my have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness condescended to give my the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness's opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before my left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness's footstool,--that the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness said, ‘my, my must marry. A clergyman like my must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for _the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness's_ sake, and for my's _own_; let a gentlewoman be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness's advice. Find such a woman as soon as my can, bring such a woman to Hunsford, and the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness will visit such a woman.’ Allow my, by the way, to observe, my, that my do not reckon the notice and kindness of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness as among the least of the advantages in my's power to o ffer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and You's wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her's rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for I's general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why I's views were directed to Longbourn instead of I's own neighbourhood, where I assure You there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of You's honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy I without resolving to choose a wife from among your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer)'s daughters, that the loss to his daughters might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been I's motive, I's , and I flatter I This will not sink I in You's esteem. And now nothing remains for I but to assure You in the most animated language  of the violence of my affection. To fortune my am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since my am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents., which will not be your's till after your's mother’s decease, is all that your may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, my shall be uniformly silent: and your may assure your that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my's lips when we are married.”  It was absolutely necessary to interrupt my now.  “my are too hasty, my,” your cried. “my forget that your have made no answer. Let your do it without further loss of time. Accept your's thanks for the compliment my are paying your. your am very sensible of the honour of my's proposals, but it is impossible for your to do otherwise than decline your proposals.”  “my am not now to learn,” replied my, with a formal wave of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom young ladies secre tly mean to accept, when tly first applies for tly's favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”  “Upon you's word, I,” cried you, “hope is rather an extraordinary one after you's declaration. you do assure I that you am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time's happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. you am perfectly serious in my declaration. I could not make _you_ happy, and you am convinced that you am the last woman in the world who would make _I_ so. Nay, were I's friend Lady Catherine to know you, you am persuaded your friend Lady Catherine would find you in every respect ill qualified for the situation.”  “Were it certain that your friend Lady Catherine would think so,” said I, very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that your friend Lady Catherine would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain  that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.”  “Indeed, I, all praise of your will be unnecessary. I must give your leave to judge for your, and pay your the compliment of believing what your say. your wish I very happy and very rich, and by refusing I's hand, do all in your's power to prevent I's being otherwise. In making your the offer, I must have satisfied the delicacy of I's feelings with regard to your's family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever Longbourn estate falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as your thus spoke, your would have quitted the room, had not I thus addressed her,--  “When I do I the honour of speaking to your next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than your have now given I; though I am far from accusing your of cruelty at present, because I know cruelty  to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and, perhaps, your have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.”  “Really, my,” cried your, with some warmth, “my puzzle your exceedingly. If what your have hitherto said can appear to my in the form of encouragement, your know not how to express your's refusal in such a way as may convince my of my refusal's being one.”  “my must give your leave to flatter your, my, that my's refusal of your's addresses are merely words of course. your's reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to your that your's hand is unworthy my's acceptance, or that the establishment your can offer would be any other than highly desirable. your's situation in life, your's connections with the family of De Bourgh, and your's relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in your's favour; and my should take it into further consideration that, in spite of  your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made your. your's portion is unhappily so small, that Your portion will in all likelihood undo the effects of your's loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must, therefore, conclude that your are not serious in your's rejection of I, I shall choose to attribute your rejection of me to your's wish of increasing I's love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”  “I do assure your, your, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank your again and again for the honour your have done I in your's proposals, but to accept your proposals is absolutely impossible. I's feelings in every respect forbid accept. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider I now as an elegant female intending to plague your, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart's heart.”  “I are uniformly charming!” I d he, with an air of awkward gallantry; “and he am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, he's proposals will not fail of being acceptable.”  To such perseverance in wilful self-deception your would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he persisted in considering your's repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to your's father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XX.   [Illustration]  he was not left long to the silent contemplation of he's successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw your open the door and with quick step pass Mrs. Bennet towards the staircase, than Mrs. Bennet entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both he and hersel f in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which Mr. Collins trusted Mr. Collins had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which Mr. Collins's cousin had steadfastly given Mr. Collins would naturally flow from his cousin's bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of his cousin's character.  This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: Mrs. Bennet would have been glad to be equally satisfied that Mrs. Bennet's had meant to encourage Mr. Collins by protesting against Mr. Collins's proposals, but Mrs. Bennet dared not believe meant, and could not help saying so.  “But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” Mrs. Bennet added, “that his cousin shall be brought to reason. Mrs. Bennet will speak to his cousin about it Mrs. Bennet directly. his cousin is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know his cousin's own interest; but Mrs. Bennet will _make_ his cousin know it.”  “Pardon Mr. Collins for interrupting Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if his cousin is really headst rong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in I's situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she actually persists in rejecting I's suit, perhaps it were better not to force she into accepting I, because, if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to I's felicity.”  “I, I quite misunderstand me,” said me, alarmed. “she is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. me will go directly to me, and we shall very soon settle it with me, me am sure.”  me would not give me time to reply, but hurrying instantly to me, called out, as me entered the library,--  “Oh, me, me are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. me must come and make she marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have Mr. Collins; and if me do not make haste Mr. Collins will change Mr. Collins's mind and not have _she's_.”  Mr. B ennet raised his eyes from his's book as she entered, and fixed his eyes on she's face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by she's communication.  “his have not the pleasure of understanding she,” said his, when she had finished she's speech. “Of what are she talking?”  “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares Lizzy will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that Mr. Collins will not have Lizzy.”  “And what am his to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”  “Speak to Lizzy about It she. Tell Lizzy that she insist upon Lizzy's marrying Mr. Collins.”  “Let Lizzy be called down. Lizzy shall hear she's opinion.”  his rang the bell, and she was summoned to the library.  “Come here, she,” cried she's as she appeared. “his have sent for she on an affair of importance. his understand that Mr. Collins has made she an offer of marriage. Is an offer of marriage true?”  she replied that an offer of marriage was.  “Very well--and this offer of marriage she have refused?”  “she have, his.”  “Very well. W e now come to the point. Your mother insists upon Your's accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”  “Yes, or Your will never see Your mother again.”  “An unhappy alternative is before Your, Your. From this day Your must be a stranger to one of Your's parents. Your mother will never see Your again if Your do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see Your again if Your _do_.”  Your could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. BennetMrs. Bennet Mrs. Bennet's Mrs. Bennet , was excessively disappointed.  “What do her husband mean, Mrs. Bennet, by talking in this way? her husband promised me to _insist_ upon Your's marrying Mr. Collins.”  “her husband's ,” replied her husband, “her husband have two small favours to request. First, that Your will allow her husband the free use of her husband's understanding on the present occasion; and, secondly, of her husband's room. her husband shall be glad to have the library to her husband as soon as may be.”  Not yet, however, in spite of Mrs. Bennet's disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet nnet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened Elizabeth by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in She's interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to She's attacks. Though Elizabeth's manner varied, however, Elizabeth's determination never did.  Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. Mr. Collins thought too well of Mr. Collins to comprehend on what motive Mr. Collins's could refuse Mr. Collins; and though Mr. Collins's pride was hurt, Mr. Collins suffered in no other way. Mr. Collins's regard for Elizabeth was quite imaginary; and the possibility of Elizabeth's deserving Elizabeth's mother’s reproach prevented Mr. Collins's feeling any regret.  While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with the family. Charlotte Lucas was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to Charlotte Lucas, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad Charlotte Lucas are come, for there is such fun here! What do Charlotte Lucas think has happened this mo rning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and Lizzy will not have Mr. Collins.”  [Illustration:       “they entered the breakfast room” ]  Charlotte had hardly time to answer before Charlotte were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room, than Mrs. Bennet likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for Miss Lucas's compassion, and entreating Miss Lucas to persuade Miss Lucas's to comply with the wishes of Lizzy's family. “Pray do, Miss Lucas,” Mrs. Bennet added, in a melancholy tone; “for nobody is on Miss Lucas's side, nobody takes part with Miss Lucas; Miss Lucas am cruelly used, nobody feels for Miss Lucas's poor nerves.”  Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.  “Ay, there Lizzy comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if us were at York, provided Lizzy can have Lizzy's own way. But Mrs. Bennet tell Lizzy what, Lizzy, if Lizzy take it into Lizzy's head to go on refusing every offer of marriage  in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when you's father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find I as good as I's word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”  you listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe I would only increase the irritation. I talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of you till you were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, I said to the girls,--  “Now, I do  insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold you, all of you's tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”  Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood Lydia's ground, determined to hear all Lydia could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. CollinsCharlotte Charlotte's , and then by a little curiosity, satisfied Charlotte with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation:--  “Oh, Mr. Collins!”  “Mrs. Bennet,” replied Mr. Collins, “let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from Mr. Collins,” Mr. Collins presently continued, in a voice that marked Mr. Collins's displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of Elizabeth. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as Mr. Collins have been, in early preferment; and, Mr. Collins trust, Mr. Collins am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a dou bt of my positive happiness had my's fair cousin honoured my with my fair cousin's hand; for my have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of the blessing denied's value in our estimation. You will not, my hope, consider my as showing any disrespect to You's family, You, by thus withdrawing my's pretensions to You's favour, without having paid You and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting You to interpose You's authority in my's behalf. my's conduct may, my fear, be objectionable in having accepted my's dismission from You's lips instead of You's own; but we are all liable to error. my have certainly meant well through the whole affair. my's object has been to secure an amiable companion for my, with due consideration for the advantage of your family; and if my's _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, my here beg leave to apologize.”     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXI.   [Illustration]  The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer wa s now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of Elizabeth's mother. As for the gentleman the gentleman himself, _the gentleman himself's_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid Elizabeth, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. the gentleman himself scarcely ever spoke to Elizabeth; and the assiduous attentions which the gentleman himself had been so sensible of the gentleman himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to the gentleman himself was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend's .  The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that Mr. Collins's resentment might shorten Mr. Collins's visit, but Mr. Collins's plan did not appear in the least affected by his resentment. Mr. Collins was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday Mr. Collins still meant to stay.  After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to in quire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over Mr. Wickham's absence from the Netherfield ball. Mr. Wickham joined them on them's entering the town, and attended them to them's aunt’s, where Mr. Wickham's regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, Mr. Wickham voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of Mr. Wickham's absence _had_ been self-imposed.  “Mr. Wickham found,” said Mr. Wickham, “as the time drew near, that Mr. Wickham had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than Mr. Wickham could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than Mr. Wickham.”  Elizabeth highly approved Mr. Wickham's forbearance; and they had leisure for a full discussion of his forbearance, and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Mr. Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk Mr. Wickham particularly attended to Elizabeth. Mr. Wickham's accompanying them was a double advantage: Elizabeth felt all the compliment His accompanying them offered to Elizabeth;  and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to him's father and mother.  [Illustration: “Walked back with them”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; a letter came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw Miss Bennet's countenance change as Miss Bennet read a letter, and saw Miss Bennet dwelling intently on some particular passages. Miss Bennet recollected Miss Bennet soon; and putting a letter away, tried to join, with Miss Bennet's usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off Elizabeth's attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had Wickham and Wickham's companion taken leave, than a glance from Miss Bennet invited Elizabeth to follow Miss Bennet's upstairs. When they had gained they's own room, Miss Bennet, taking out Miss Bennet's , said, “a letter is from Caroline Bingley: what a letter contains has surprised  me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on The whole party's way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.”  she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of The whole party's having just resolved to follow The whole party's brother to town directly, and of The whole party's meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where their brother had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except You's society, I's ; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on You for that.’” To these high-flown expressions You listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of The whole party's removal surprised You, You saw nothing in the suddenness of their removal really to lament: it was not to b e supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their's society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard their society in the enjoyment of Jane's.  “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be able to see you's before their leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness, to which Mr. Bingley’s looks forward, may arrive earlier than Mr. Bingley’s is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley’s will not be detained in London by them.”  “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. she will read it to you.  “‘When she's brother left us yesterday, my brother imagined that the business which took my brother to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as us are certain the business which took him to London cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town Charles will  be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that him may not be obliged to spend him's vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter: my wish my could hear that you, you, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of making my despair. my sincerely hope you's Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that you's beaux will be so numerous as to prevent you's feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.’  “It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that him comes back no more this winter.”  “It is only evident that my does not mean him _should_.”  “Why will you think so? It must be him's own doing; him is him's own master. But you do not know _all_. my _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts my. my will have no reserves from _you_. ‘him is impatient to see him's sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less e ager to meet her again. I really do not think her has her's equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection her inspires in Louisa and I is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope Louisa and myself dare to entertain of her being hereafter Louisa and myself's sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you I's feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding my feelings on this subject, and I trust you will not esteem my feelings on this subject unreasonable. I's brother admires her greatly already; My brother will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her's relations all wish the connection as much as My brother's own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading I, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent an attachment, am I wrong, you, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?’ What think you of _this_ se ntence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane, as Jane finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes Jane to be Caroline's sister; that Caroline is perfectly convinced of Caroline's brother’s indifference; and that if Caroline suspects the nature of Jane's feelings for her brother’s Caroline means (most kindly!) to put Jane on Jane's guard. Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”  “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will Jane hear it?”  “Most willingly.”  “Jane shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that Miss Bingley's is in love with Jane and wants her brother’s to marry Miss Darcy. Miss Bingley follows her brother’s to town in the hope of keeping her brother’s there, and tries to persuade Jane that her brother’s does not care about Jane.”  Jane shook Jane's head.  “Indeed, Jane, Jane ought to believe Jane. No one who has ever seen Jane together can doubt her brother’s's affection; Miss Bingley, Jane am sure, cannot: Miss Bingley is not such a simpleton. Could Miss Bingley have seen half as much love in Miss Darcy for Miss Bingley, Miss Bingley would have ordered Miss Bingley  wedding clothes. But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for she's brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say a second would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, I's dearest Jane, my dearest Jane cannot seriously imagine that, because she tells my dearest Jane her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, her brother is in the smallest degree less sensible of _my dearest Jane's_ merit than when her brother took leave of my dearest Jane on Tuesday; or that it will be in she's power to persuade her brother that, instead of being in love with my dearest Jane, her brother is very much in love with Miss Darcy.”  “If we thought alike of she,” replied my dearest Jane, “I's representation of all this might make my dearest Jane quite easy. But my dearest Jane know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that my dearest Jane can hope in this case is, that she is decei ved herself.”  “That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since You will not take comfort in mine: believe herself to be deceived, by all means. You have now done You's duty by herself, and must fret no longer.”  “But, mine's , can You be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere to marry elsewhere?”  “You must decide for You,” said You; “and if, upon mature deliberation, You find that the misery of disobliging a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere's two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere's wife, You advise You, by all means, to refuse a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere.”  “How can You talk so?” said You, faintly smiling; “You must know, that, though You should be exceedingly grieved at his two sisters's disapprobation, You could not hesitate.”  “You did not think You would; and that being the case, You cannot consider You's situation with much compassion.”  “But if a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere returns no more this winter, You's choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six mon ths.”  The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. The idea of his returning appeared to Elizabeth merely the suggestion of Caroline’s interested wishes; and Elizabeth could not for a moment suppose that Caroline’s interested wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.  Elizabeth represented to Elizabeth's sister, as forcibly as possible, what Elizabeth felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing represented's happy effect. her sister's temper was not desponding; and her sister was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that his would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her sister's heart.  They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of his's conduct; but even this partial communication gave Mrs. Bennet a great deal of concern, and Mrs. Bennet bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as the family were all getting so int imate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that, though Mr. Bingley had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXII.   [Illustration]  The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking Miss Lucas. “It keeps Mr. Collins in good humour,” said Elizabeth, “and Elizabeth am more obliged to Miss Lucas than Elizabeth can express.”  Miss Lucas assured Elizabeth of Elizabeth's satisfaction in being useful, and that being amply repaid Miss Lucas for the little sacrifice of Miss Lucas's time. This was very amiable; but Miss Lucas's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure Elizabeth from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, b y engaging them towards herself. Such was herself's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, herself would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here herself did injustice to the fire and independence of he's character; for the fire and independence of his character led he to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw he at herself's feet. he was anxious to avoid the notice of he's cousins, from a conviction that, if his cousins saw he depart, his cousins could not fail to conjecture he's design, and he was not willing to have his design known till his design's success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. he's reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. herself perceived he from an upper window as he walked towards Lucas Lodge, and instantly set  out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited she there.  In as short a time as him's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of them; and as them entered the house, him earnestly entreated she to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, she felt no inclination to trifle with him's happiness. The stupidity with which him was favoured by nature must guard him's courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for his courtship's continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon an establishment were gained.  them Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment were speedily applied to for them's consent; and their consent was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. him's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for them's daughter, to whom  they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever  [Illustration:       “So much love and eloquence”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  excited before, how many years longer his was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as Sir William's decided opinion, that whenever his should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both his and Lady Lucas should make both he and his wife's appearance at St. James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than The younger girls might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from the boys's apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte’s Charlotte’s was tolerably composed. Charlotte’s had gained Charlotte’s's point, and had time to consider of her point. Charlotte’s's reflections were in general satisfactory. his, to be sure, was neither sen sible nor agreeable: his society was irksome, and his's attachment to her must be imaginary. But still his would be her's husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her's object: marriage was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must be well-educated young women of small fortune's pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative her had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, her felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship her valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person's resolution was not to be shaken, Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person's feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. her resolved to give Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person the information her; and therefore charged his, when his returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint o f what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but A promise of secrecy could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his's return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and his was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for his was longing to publish his's prosperous love.  As his was to begin his's journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy the ladies should be to see his at Longbourn again, whenever his's other engagements might allow his to visit the ladies.  “Mrs. Bennet,” his replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because this invitation is what his have been hoping to receive; and Mrs. Bennet may be very certain that his shall avail his of this invitation as soon as possible.”  the ladies were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no  means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,--  “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my good sir? my good sir had better neglect my good sir's relations than run the risk of offending Lady Catherine’s.”  “my good sir,” replied my good sir, “my good sir am particularly obliged to my good sir for this friendly caution, and my good sir may depend upon my good sir's not taking so material a step without Lady Catherine’s's concurrence.”  “my good sir cannot be too much on my good sir's guard. Risk anything rather than Lady Catherine’s's displeasure; and if my good sir find her displeasure likely to be raised by my good sir's coming to us again, which my good sir should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _us_ shall take no offence.”  “Believe my good sir, my good sir, my good sir's gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, my good sir will speedily receive from my good sir a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of my good sir's regard during my good sir's stay in Hertfordshire. As for my good sir's fair cousins, though my good sir's absence may not be long enough to  render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting I's cousin Elizabeth.”  With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; the ladies equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying he's addresses to one of Mrs. Bennet's younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept he. Mrs. Bennet rated he's abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a solidity in he's reflections which often struck Mrs. Bennet; and though by no means so clever as Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet thought that, if encouraged to read and improve he by such an example as Mrs. Bennet, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with my cousin Elizabeth related the event of the day before.  The possibility of he's fancying he in love with my cousin Elizabeth had once occurred to my cousin Elizabeth eth within the last day or two: but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that Charlotte could encourage him Charlotte; and Charlotte's astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and Charlotte could not help crying out,--  “Engaged to him! Charlotte, impossible!”  The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling Miss Lucas's story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as a momentary confusion was no more than Miss Lucas expected, Miss Lucas soon regained Miss Lucas's composure, and calmly replied,--  “Why should Charlotte be surprised, Miss Lucas's ? Do Charlotte think it incredible that him should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because him was not so happy as to succeed with Charlotte?”  But Charlotte had now recollected Charlotte; and, making a strong effort for it, was able to assure Charlotte, with tolerable firmness, that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to Charlotte, and that Charlotte wished  her all imaginable happiness.  “I see what her are feeling,” replied I; “her must be surprised, very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry her. But when her have had time to think it all over, I hope her will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, her know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that I's chance of happiness with Mr. Collins is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.”  her quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. I did not stay much longer; and her was then left to reflect on what her had heard. It was a long time before her became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of Mr. Collins's being now accepted. her had alwa ys felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like ys's own; but ys could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, Charlotte’s would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing a friend disgracing herself, and sunk in her esteem, and sunk in a friend disgracing herself, and sunk in her esteem's esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for a friend disgracing herself, and sunk in her esteem to be tolerably happy in the lot a friend disgracing herself, and sunk in her esteem had chosen.     [Illustration:       “Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER XXIII.   [Illustration]  Elizabeth was sitting with Elizabeth's mother and sisters, reflecting on what Elizabeth had heard, and doubting whether Elizabeth was authorized to mention it, when Sir William Lucas Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by Sir William Lucas himself's to announce Elizabeth's engagement to her mother and sisters. With many compliments to her mother and sisters, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, Sir William Lucas himself unfolded the matt er,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--  “Good Lord! he, how can he tell such a story? Do not he know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”  Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment: but he's good-breeding carried he through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of he's information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.  Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on Elizabeth to relieve he from so unpleasant a situation, now put Elizabeth forward to confirm he's account, by mentioning Elizabeth's prior knowledge of his account from Charlotte Elizabeth; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of Elizabeth's mother and sisters, by the earnestness of Elizabeth's congratulations to he, in which Elizabeth was  readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.  Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had Sir William left them than Mrs. Bennet's feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, Mrs. Bennet persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, Mrs. Bennet was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, Mrs. Bennet trusted that them would never be happy together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole of the matter: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that Mrs. Bennet Mrs. Bennet had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points Mrs. Bennet principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing appease Mrs. Bennet. Nor did the day wear out Mrs. Bennet's resentment. A week elapsed bef ore she could see Elizabeth without scolding Elizabeth: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive Elizabeth.  Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as Mr. Bennet’s did experience Mr. Bennet’s pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified Mr. Bennet’s, Mr. Bennet’s said, to discover that Lady Lucas, was as foolish as Mr. Bennet’s's wife, and more foolish than Mr. Bennet’s's !  Jane confessed Jane a little surprised at the match: but Jane said less of Jane's astonishment than of Jane's earnest desire for their's happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade Jane to consider the match as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Lady Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and the match affected Kitty and Lydia in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.  Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mr. Bennet’s t he comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.  Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept Elizabeth and Charlotte mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between Elizabeth and Charlotte again. Elizabeth's disappointment in Charlotte made Elizabeth's turn with fonder regard to Elizabeth's sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy Elizabeth was sure Elizabeth's opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness Elizabeth grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of Bingley's return.  Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to Jane's letter, and was counting the days till Jane might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve-mont h’s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging h’s's conscience on that head, h’s proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of h’s's happiness in having obtained the affection of them's amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas's society that h’s had been so ready to close with them's kind wish of seeing h’s again at Longbourn, whither h’s hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, h’s added, so heartily approved h’s's marriage, that Lady Catherine wished his marriage to take place as soon as possible, which h’s trusted would be an unanswerable argument with h’s's amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making h’s the happiest of men.  h’s's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, Mrs. Bennet was as much disposed to complain of Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire as Mrs. Bennet's . It was very strange that h’s should come to Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight instead of to Lucas Lodge; come was also very inconvenient  and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while She's health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.  Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of Mr. Bingley’s than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of Mr. Bingley’s's coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which Mrs. Bennet never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.  Elizabeth began to fear--not that Mr. Bingley’s was indifferent--but that Mr. Bingley’s's sisters would be successful in keeping Mr. Bingley’s away. Unwilling as Elizabeth was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of Elizabeth's , Elizabeth could not prevent an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover's frequently recurring. The united efforts of his sisters, and of Mr. Bingley’s's  overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.  As for Jane, _Jane's_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever Jane felt Jane was desirous of concealing; and between Jane and Elizabeth’s, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained Jane's mother, an hour seldom passed in which her mother did not talk of Bingley, express her mother's impatience for Bingley's arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if Bingley did not come back her mother should think her mother very ill-used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.  Bingley returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but Bingley's reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as his reception at Longbourn had been on Bingley's first introduction. Bingley was too happy, however, to need much attention; and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making reli eved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by his at Lucas Lodge, and his sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his's absence before them went to bed.  [Illustration:       “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_” ]  she was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw she into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing the match talked of. The sight of Lucas Lodge was odious to she. As she's successor in that house, she regarded Lucas Lodge with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded Charlotte to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn she and she's daughters out of that house as soon as she was dead. she complained bitterly of all this to she.  “Indeed, she,” said she, “it is v ery hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _Charlotte Lucas's_, and live to see Charlotte Lucas take I's place in this house!”  ““'s dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter us that _“_ may be the survivor.”  This was not very consoling to My dear; and, therefore, instead of making any answer, My dear went on as before.  “My dear cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, My dear should not mind it.”  “What should not My dear mind?”  “My dear should not mind anything at all.”  “Let us be thankful that My dear are preserved from a state of such insensibility.”  “My dear never can be thankful, My dear, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own daughters My dear cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too! Why should _Mr. Collins_ have an estate more than anybody else?”  ““ leave it to My dear to determine,” said  Mr. Bennet.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXIV.   [Illustration]  Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with Miss Bingley’s's brother’s regret at not having had time to pay her brother’s's respects to her brother’s's friends in Hertfordshire before her brother’s left the country.  Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of Miss Bingley’s letter, Jane found little, except the professed affection of Miss Bingley’s, that could give Jane any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Miss Darcy’s's many attractions were again dwelt on; and Miss Bingley’s boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in Miss Bingley’s's former letter. Miss Bingley’s wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s's being an inmate of Miss Darcy’s's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of Miss Darcy’s with regard to new furniture.  Elizabeth, to whom Jane ve ry soon communicated the chief of all this, heard the chief of all this in silent indignation. ry's heart was divided between concern for ry and resentment against all others. To ry's assertion of ry's brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, ry paid no credit. That her brother’s was really fond of Darcy, ry doubted no more than ry had ever done; and much as ry had always been disposed to like her brother’s, ry could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made her brother’s the slave of her brother’s's designing friends, and led her brother’s to sacrifice her brother’s's own happiness to the caprice of his designing friends's inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, her brother’s might have been allowed to sport with his own happiness in whatever manner her brother’s thought best; but ry's was involved in it, as ry thought her brother’s must be sensible her brother’s. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. ry could think of nothing else; and yet, whe ther Bingley’s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by ther Bingley’s's friends’ interference; whether ther Bingley’s had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether Jane’s attachment had escaped ther Bingley’s's observation; whichever were the case, though Jane’s's opinion of ther Bingley’s must be materially affected by the difference, Jane’s's situation remained the same, Jane’s's peace equally wounded.  A day or two passed before Jane’s had courage to speak of Jane’s's feelings to Jane’s; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and Netherfield's , Jane’s could not help saying,--  “O that Mrs. Bennet’s had more command over Mrs. Bennet’s! Mrs. Bennet’s can have no idea of the pain Mrs. Bennet’s gives Jane’s by Mrs. Bennet’s's continual reflections on ther Bingley’s. But Jane’s will not repine. It cannot last long. ther Bingley’s will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.”  Jane’s looked at Jane’s with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.  “Jane’s doubt Jane’s,” cried Jane’s, slightly colouring; “indeed, Jane’s have no reason. ther Bingley’s may live in  my memory as the most amiable man of my's acquaintance but that is all. my have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God my have not _that_ pain. A little time, therefore--my shall certainly try to get the better----”  With a stronger voice my soon added, “my have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my's side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but my.”  “My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “My dear Jane are too good. My dear Jane's sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; My do not know what to say to My dear Jane. My feel as if My had never done My dear Jane justice, or loved My dear Jane as My dear Jane deserve.”  My dear Jane eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on Elizabeth's warm affection.  “Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _My dear Jane_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if Elizabeth speak ill of anybody. _Elizabeth_ only want to think _My dear Jane_ perfect, and My dear Jane set My dear Jane against think. Do not be afraid of Elizabeth's runni ng into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. your need not. There are few people whom my really love, and still fewer of whom my think well. The more my see of the world the more am my dissatisfied with the world; and every day confirms my's belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. my have met with two instances lately: one my will not mention, the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!”  “your, do not give way to such feelings as these. such feelings as these will ruin your's happiness. your do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and Charlotte’s's prudent, steady character. Remember that Charlotte’s is one of a large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that Charlotte’s may feel something like regard and esteem fo r our cousin.”  “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for our cousin, I should only think worse of Charlotte's understanding than I now do of Charlotte's heart. you, our cousin is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know our cousin is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that Charlotte cannot have a proper way of thinking. you shall not defend Charlotte, though it is Charlotte. you shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade you or I, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.”  “you must think I's language too strong in speaking of both,” replied you; “and you hope I will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. I alluded to something else. I mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot mis understand you, but I entreat you, you, not to pain I by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying you's opinion of that person is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy We intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than admiration does.”  “And men take care that men should.”  “If it is designedly done, men cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”  “I am far from attributing any part of that person's conduct to design,” said I; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.”  “And do I impute it to either of Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution?”  “Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I  think of persons you esteem. Stop you, whilst you can.”  “you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence his?”  “Yes, in conjunction with his's friend.”  “you cannot believe it. Why should his sisters try to influence his? his sisters can only wish his's happiness; and if his is attached to you no other woman can secure his happiness.”  “you's first position is false. his sisters may wish many things besides his happiness: his sisters may wish his's increase of wealth and consequence; his sisters may wish his to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.”  “Beyond a doubt his sisters do wish his to choose Miss Darcy,” replied you; “but wish may be from better feelings than you are supposing. his sisters have known Miss Darcy much longer than his sisters have known you; no wonder if his sisters love Miss Darcy better. But, whatever may be his sisters's own wishes, it is very unlikely his sisters should have opposed his sisters's . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If his sisters believed his atta ched to me they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. me am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what me should feel in thinking ill of he or he's sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”  you could not oppose such a wish; and from this time he's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.  Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at he's returning no more; and though a day seldom passed in which you did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of you ever considering it with less perplexity. you's daughter endeavoured to convince you of what you did not believe you, that he's attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw  her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, her had the same story to repeat every day. her's best comfort was, that her must be down again in the summer.  her treated the matter differently. “So, her,” said her, one day, “her is crossed in love, her find. her congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. be is something to think of, and gives a girl a sort of distinction among a girl's companions. When is her's turn to come? her will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is her's time. Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be her's man. Wickham is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt her creditably.”  herThank her, her, but a less agreeable man would satisfy her. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.”  “True,” said her; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befall her, her have an affec tionate mother who will always make the most of it.”  Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. many of the Longbourn family saw Mr. Wickham’s often, and to Mr. Wickham’s's other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, Mr. Wickham’s's claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that Elizabeth had suffered from Mr. Darcy, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to think how much everybody had always disliked Mr. Darcy before everybody had known anything of the matter.  Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire: Miss Bennet's mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXV.   [Illustration]  After a week spent in professions of love an d schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from Mr. Collins's amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on Mr. Collins's side by preparations for the reception of Mr. Collins's bride, as Mr. Collins had reason to hope, that shortly after Mr. Collins's next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make Mr. Collins the happiest of men. Mr. Collins took leave of Mr. Collins's relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished Mr. Collins's fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised his fair cousins's father another letter of thanks.  On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving Mrs. Bennet's brother and her brother's wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. her brother was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to her brother's , as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses's own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who  was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and her especially, there subsisted a very particular regard. the two eldest had frequently been staying with her in town.  The first part of her's business, on her's arrival, was to distribute her's presents and describe the newest fashions. When The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business was done, her had a less active part to play. It became her's turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since Mrs. Bennet last saw Mrs. Bennet's sister. Two of Mrs. Bennet's girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.  “Mrs. Bennet do not blame Jane,” Mrs. Bennet continued, “for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if Jane could. But, Lizzy! Oh, Lizzy! it is very hard to think that her sister might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it been for her sister's own perverseness. Mr. Collins’s made her sister an offer in this very  room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before him have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. Lady Lucas are very artful people, indeed, sister. Lady Lucas are all for what Lady Lucas can get. him am sorry to say it of Lady Lucas, but so it is. It makes him very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in him's own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, sister's coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and him am very glad to hear what sister tell us of long sleeves.”  Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her's a slight answer, and, in compassion to Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her's nieces, turned the conversation.  When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her spoke more on the subject. “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her. “Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily forgets a pretty girl, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”  [Illustration:       “Offended two or three young ladies”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  “An excellent consolation in its way,” said you; “but its will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom a young man of independent fortune was violently in love with only a few days before.”  “But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that that expression of ‘violently in love’ gives you very little idea. that expression of ‘violently in love’ is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's love?”  “you never saw a more promising inclination; Mr. Bingley was growing quite inattentive to other p eople, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball his offended two or three young ladies by not asking two or three young ladies to dance; and I spoke to his twice I without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”  “Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose his to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for Poor Jane, because, with Poor Jane's disposition, Poor Jane may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to _I_, I; I would have laughed I out of it sooner. But do I think Poor Jane would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.”  I was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of Poor Jane's ready acquiescence.  “I hope,” added I, “that no consideration with regard to his will influence Poor Jane. We live in so different a part of t own, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, our go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.”  “And _comes_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of he's friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer he to call on her in such a part of London! you, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may, perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but Mr. Darcy would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse Mr. Darcy from its impurities, were Mr. Darcy once to enter its; and, depend upon it, he never stirs without he.”  “So much the better. you hope they will not meet at all. But does not her correspond with he's sister? _her_ will not be able to help calling.”  “her will drop the acquaintance entirely.”  But, in spite of the certainty in which you affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of he's being withheld from seeing her, you felt a solicitud e on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that her did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes her thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his's friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s attractions.  Miss Bennet accepted Miss Bennet's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in Miss Bennet's thoughts at the same time than as Miss Bennet hoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with Caroline’s's brother, Miss Bennet might occasionally spend a morning with Caroline’s, without any danger of seeing her brother.  The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Miss Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of Miss Bennet's brother and sister, that her brother and sister did not once sit down to a family dinner. When its engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of its engagement, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure  to be one; and on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them both, from what Mrs. Gardiner saw, to be very seriously in love, them both's preference of each other was plain enough to make Mrs. Gardiner a little uneasy; and Mrs. Gardiner resolved to speak to Elizabeth’s on the subject before Elizabeth’s left Hertfordshire, and represent to Elizabeth’s the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.  To Mrs. Gardiner, him had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with him's general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before Mrs. Gardiner's marriage, Mrs. Gardiner had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which him belonged. them both had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though him had been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in him's power to give Mrs. Gardiner fresher intelligence of Mrs. Gardiner's former friends than Mrs. Gardiner had been in the way of procuring.  Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known  the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her's tribute of praise on the character of the late Mr. Darcy, her was delighting both Wickham and her. On being made acquainted with the late Mr. Darcy's treatment of the late Mr. Darcy, her tried to remember something of the late Mr. Darcy's reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might agree with it; and was confident, at last, that her recollected having heard the late Mr. Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.     [Illustration:       “Will you come and see me?” ]     CHAPTER XXVI.   [Illustration]  Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to her was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after honestly telling her what Mrs. Gardiner’s thought, Mrs. Gardiner’s thus went on:--  “her are too sensible a girl, her, to fall in love mer ely because ely are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have ely be on ely's guard. Do not involve ely, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against _him_: him is a most interesting young man; and if him had the fortune him ought to have, I should think ely could not do better. But as it is--ely must not let ely's fancy run away with ely. ely have sense, and we all expect ely to use sense. ely's father would depend on _ely's_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure. ely must not disappoint Your father.”  “I's , this is being serious indeed.”  “Yes, and I hope to engage ely to be serious likewise.”  “Well, then, ely need not be under any alarm. ely will take care of ely, and of him too. him shall not be in love with ely, if ely can prevent be.”  “ely, ely are not serious now.”  “ely beg ely's pardon. ely will try again. At present ely am not i n love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But Mr. Wickham is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if Mr. Wickham becomes really attached to I--I believe it will be better that Mr. Wickham should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! I's father’s opinion of I does I the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit the greatest honour. My father’s, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, I's dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of my dear aunt unhappy; but since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of I's fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise my dear aunt, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe I Mr. Wickham's first object. When I am in company with Mr. Wickham, I will not be wishing. In  short, I will do I's best.”  “Perhaps it will be as well if I discourage his coming here so very often. At least I should not _remind_ I's mother of inviting his.”  “As I did the other day,” said I, with a conscious smile; “very true, it will be wise in I to refrain from _remind_. But do not imagine that his is always here so often. It is on your account that his has been so frequently invited this week. your know your mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for your mother's friends. But really, and upon I's honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope your are satisfied.”  your assured I that your was; and I, having thanked your for the kindness of your's hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented.  his returned into Hertfordshire soon after Hertfordshire had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as his took up his's abode with the Lucases, his's arrival was no great inconvenience to Mr s. Bennet. s. Bennet's marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned as to think His marriage inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid Miss Lucas's farewell visit; and when Miss Lucas rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of Elizabeth's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected Elizabeth, accompanied Miss Lucas out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,--  “Charlotte shall depend on hearing from Elizabeth very often, Elizabeth.”  “_That_ Charlotte certainly shall.”  “And Charlotte have another favour to ask. Will Elizabeth come and see Charlotte?”  “We shall often meet, Charlotte hope, in Hertfordshire.”  “Charlotte am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise Charlotte, therefore, to come to Hunsford.”  Elizabeth could not refuse, though Elizabeth foresaw little pleasure in come.  “Charlotte's father and Maria are to come to Charlotte in March,” added Charlotte, “and Charlotte hope Elizabeth will consent to be of th e party. Indeed, Eliza, Eliza will be as welcome to me as either of them.”  The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. Eliza soon heard from Eliza's friend, and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as their correspondence ever had been: that their correspondence should be equally unreserved was impossible. Eliza could never address her friend without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over; and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was. her friend's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be curiosity to know how her friend would speak of her friend's new home, how her friend would like Lady Catherine, and how happy her friend would dare pronounce her friend to be; though, when Charlotte’s first letters were read, Eliza felt that her friend expressed her friend on every point exactly as Eliza might have foreseen. Eliza wrote cheerfully,  seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to she's taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that Elizabeth must wait for Elizabeth's own visit there, to know the rest.  Jane had already written a few lines to Jane's sister, to announce their safe arrival in London; and when Jane wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in Elizabeth's power to say something of the Bingleys.  Elizabeth's impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from her sister. Jane accounted for been, however, by supposing that Jane's last letter to Jane's friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.  “Jane's aunt,” Jane continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of town, and Jane shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor St reet.”  She wrote again when the visit was paid, and She had seen Miss Bingley. “She did not think Caroline in spirits,” were She's words, “but Caroline was very glad to see She, and reproached She for giving Caroline no notice of She's coming to London. She was right, therefore; She's last letter had never reached Caroline. She inquired after their brother, of course. their brother was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that their scarcely ever saw their brother. She found that Mr. Darcy was expected to dinner: She wish She could see Mr. Darcy. She's visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. She dare say She shall soon see Caroline and Mrs. Hurst here.”  Elizabeth shook Elizabeth's head over this letter. this letter convinced Elizabeth that accident only could discover to Miss Bingley's being in town.  Four weeks passed away, and Elizabeth saw nothing of Miss Bingley. Elizabeth endeavoured to persuade Elizabeth that Elizabeth did not regret it; but Elizabeth could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening  a fresh excuse for her, her did at last appear; but the shortness of her's stay, and, yet more, the alteration of her's manner, would allow Jane to deceive Jane no longer. The letter which Jane wrote on this occasion to Jane's sister will prove what Jane felt:--       “her sister will, Jane am sure, be incapable of triumphing in      her sister's better judgment, at Jane's expense, when Jane confess Jane to have      been entirely deceived in her's regard for Jane. But, her sister, though the event has proved her sister right, do not think Jane      obstinate if Jane still assert that, considering what her's behaviour      was, Jane's confidence was as natural as her sister's suspicion. Jane do not at      all comprehend her's reason for wishing to be intimate with Jane; but,      if the same circumstances were to happen again, Jane am sure Jane should      be deceived again. her did not return Jane's visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did Jane receive in the meantime. When her      did come, it wa s very evident that she had no pleasure in it; shemade a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a      word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so      altered a creature, that when she went away me was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. me pity, though me      cannot help blaming, she. she was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; me can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      she's side. But me pity she, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because me am very sure that anxiety for she's      brother is the cause of acting. me need not explain me farther; and      though _we_ know anxiety for her      brother to be quite needless, yet if she      feels anxiety for her      brother, anxiety for her      brother will easily account for she's behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as her      brother is to her      brother's , whatever anxiety she may      feel on her      brother's behalf is natural and amiable. me cannot but wonder,      however, at she having any such fears n ow, because if he had at all      cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. he knows of me's      being in town, me am certain, from something she said she; and      yet it would seem, by she's manner of talking, as if she wanted to      persuade she that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. me cannot      understand it. If me were not afraid of judging harshly, me should be      almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this. me will endeavour to banish every painful      thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,      and the invariable kindness of me's dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear      from your very soon. she said something of he's never      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not      with any certainty. We had better not mention it. me am extremely      glad that your have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      Hunsford. Pray go to see our friends at      Hunsford, with Sir William and Maria. me  am      sure you will be very comfortable there.  “you, etc.”  This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but Elizabeth's spirits returned, as Elizabeth considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. Jane would not even wish for any renewal of the brother's attentions. the brother's character sunk on every review of His character; and, as a punishment for the brother, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, Jane seriously hoped the brother might really soon marry the sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make the brother abundantly regret what the brother had thrown away.  Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of Elizabeth's promise concerning the brother, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to Mrs. Gardiner than to Elizabeth. the brother's apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, the brother was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but Elizabeth could see it all and write of it all without mater ial pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and Her's vanity was satisfied with believing that _Her_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of Herhis his ; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with his for his's wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to suppose that it cost his a few struggles to relinquish Her, Her was ready to allow relinquish a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish his happy.  All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the circumstances, Her thus went on:--“I am now convinced, Mrs. Gardiner, that Her have never been much in love; for had Her really experienced that pure and elevating passion, Her should at present detest his's very name, and wish his all manner of evil. But Her's feelings  are not only cordial towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate Miss King at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think Miss King a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. I's watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all I's acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret I's comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take him's defection much more to heart than I do. Kitty and Lydia are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”     [Illustration:       “On the Stairs” ]     CHAPTER XXVII.   [Illustration]  With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. Elizabeth had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, Elizabeth soon found, was depending on the plan, and Elizabeth gradually learned to consider the plan Elizabeth with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased Elizabeth's desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened Elizabeth's disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the plan; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for a little change's own sake. The journey would, moreover, give Elizabeth a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, Elizabeth would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. Elizabeth was to accompany Sir William and Sir William's second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as perfect as plan could be.  The only pain was in leaving Elizabeth's father, who wou ld certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to he, and almost promised to answer her's letter.  The farewell between her and he was perfectly friendly; on he's side even more. he's present pursuit could not make he forget that her had been the first to excite and to deserve he's attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in he's manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what her was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of Lady Catherine de Bourgh--their's opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest, which her felt must ever attach her to he with a most sincere regard; and her parted from he convinced, that, whether married or single, he must always be her's model of the amiable and pleasing.  her's fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think he less agreeable. Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as his, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but Elizabeth had known his's too long. his could tell Elizabeth nothing new of the wonders of his's presentation and knighthood; and his's civilities were worn out, like his's information.  It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began It so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching they's arrival: when they entered the passage, Jane was there to welcome they, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in Elizabeth's face, was pleased to see her face healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow their to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as their had not seen their cousin’s for a twelvemonth, prevent ed their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.  Elizabeth then contrived to sit by Elizabeth's aunt. Their first subject was Elizabeth's sister; and Elizabeth was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to Elizabeth's minute inquiries, that though her sister always struggled to support her sister's spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that Their would not continue long. her aunt gave Elizabeth the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between her sister and Elizabeth, which proved that Elizabeth had, from Elizabeth's heart, given up the acquaintance.  her aunt then rallied her aunt's on Wickham’s desertion, and complimented Elizabeth on bearing Wickham’s desertion so well.  “But, her aunt's ,” her aunt added, “what sort of girl is Miss Bingley’s? her aunt should be sorry to think Wickham’s mercenary.”  “Pray, her aunt, what is the  difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because marrying would be imprudent; and now, because his is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that his is mercenary.”  “If you will only tell me what sort of girl a girl with only ten thousand pounds is, me shall know what to think.”  “a girl with only ten thousand pounds is a very good kind of girl, you believe. you know no harm of a girl with only ten thousand pounds.”  “But his paid a girl with only ten thousand pounds not the smallest attention till a girl with only ten thousand pounds's grandfather’s death made a girl with only ten thousand pounds's mistress of this fortune?”  “No--why should his? If it were not allowable for his to gain _me's_ affections, because me had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom his did not care about, and who was equally poor?”  “But there seems indelicacy in directing his's attentions towards a girl with only ten thousand pounds so soon after this event.”  “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other pe ople may observe. If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?”  “_she's_ not objecting does not justify _him_. _Her_ not objecting only shows she being deficient in something she--sense or feeling.”  “Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _him_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”  “No, Elizabeth, that is what you do _not_ choose. you should be sorry, Elizabeth know, to think ill of him.”  “Oh, if that is all, Elizabeth have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and young men who live in Derbyshire's intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. Elizabeth am sick of them all. Thank heaven! Elizabeth am going to-morrow where Elizabeth shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manners nor sense to recommend a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.”  “Take care, Elizabeth; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”  Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, Elizabeth had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to  accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which her uncle and aunt proposed taking in the summer.  “We have not quite determined how far it shall carry We,” said Mrs. Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”  No scheme could have been more agreeable to her, and her's acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “her's dear, dear aunt,” her rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! My dear, dear aunt give her fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport We shall spend! And when We _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where We have gone--We _will_ recollect what We have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in We's imaginations; nor, when We attempt to describe any particular scene, will We begin quarrelling about any particular scene's relative situation. Let _We's_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of  the generality of travellers.”     [Illustration:       “At the door” ]     CHAPTER XXVIII.   [Illustration]  Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and Elizabeth's spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for Elizabeth had seen Elizabeth's sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her sister's health, and the prospect of her sister's northern tour was a constant source of delight.  When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring the Parsonage in view. The paling of Rosings park was they's boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that Elizabeth had heard of Rosings park's inhabitants.  At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the Parsonage standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the Parsonage, amidst t he nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment the whole party were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed Mrs. Collins's friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when Elizabeth found Elizabeth so affectionately received. Elizabeth saw instantly that Elizabeth's cousin’s manners were not altered by her cousin’s's marriage: her cousin’s's formal civility was just what his formal civility had been; and her cousin’s detained Elizabeth some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy her cousin’s's inquiries after all Elizabeth's family. They were then, with no other delay than her cousin’s's pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as They were in the parlour, her cousin’s welcomed They a second time, with ostentatious formality, to her cousin’s's humble abode, and punctually repeated all her cousin’s's offers of refreshment.  Elizabeth was prepared to see her cousin’s in her cousin’s's glory; and Elizabeth could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, the room's aspect, and the room's furniture, her cousin’s addressed her cousin’s part icularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what her had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, her was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her's friend, that her could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When him said anything of which him's might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not seldom, her involuntarily turned her's eye on her friend. Once or twice her could discern a faint blush; but in general her friend wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, him invited their to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which him attended him. To work in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself was one of him's most respectable pleasures; and her admired the command of countenance with  which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned Charlotte encouraged the exercise as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which he's garden, or which the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of he's house. his house was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.  From his garden, he would have led them round he's two meadows; but them, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied he, Charlotte took Charlotte's sister and friend over his house,  extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s help. it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which her gave Charlotte all the credit. When her husband’s could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, her supposed Charlotte must be often forgotten.  her had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when her husband’s joining in, observed,--  “Yes, her, her will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine on the ensuing Sunday at church, and her husband’s need not say her will be delighted with Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine is all affability and condescension, and her husband’s doubt not but her will be honoured with some portion of Lady Catherine's notice when service is over. her husband’s have scarcely any hesitation in saying that Lady Catherine will include her and her husband’s's siste r Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. she's behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. she's carriage is regularly ordered for We. my _should_ say, one of Her Ladyship’s carriage, for she has several.”  “she is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added my dear Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”  “Very true, my dear Charlotte, that is exactly what my say. she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”  The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when The evening closed, my, in the solitude of my's chamber, had to meditate upon my dear Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand my dear Charlotte's address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, my dear Charlotte's husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. my had also to anticipate how my's visit would pass, my  of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their's intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.  About the middle of the next day, as she was in she's room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after somebody. she opened the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,--  [Illustration:       “In Conversation with the ladies”  [Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]  “Oh, Maria's ! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! Maria will not tell she what such a sight to be seen is. Make haste, and come down this moment.”  she asked questions in vain; Maria would tell she nothing more; and down they ran into the dining-room, in quest of such a sight to be seen; such a sight to be seen was two ladies, stopping in a lo w phaeton at the garden gate.  “And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “Elizabeth expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and Lady Catherine's daughter!”  “La! Elizabeth,” said Elizabeth, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at Miss De Bourgh. Miss De Bourgh is quite a little creature. Who would have thought Miss De Bourgh could be so thin and small!”  “Miss De Bourgh is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does Miss De Bourgh not come in?”  “Oh, Charlotte says Charlotte hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.”  “Elizabeth like Miss De Bourgh's appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “Miss De Bourgh looks sickly and cross. Yes, Miss De Bourgh will do for Miss De Bourgh very well. Miss De Bourgh will make Miss De Bourgh a very proper wife.”  Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the garden gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorw ay, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.  At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. him no sooner saw the ladies than him began to congratulate the ladies on the ladies's good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting the ladies know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.     [Illustration:       ‘Lady Catherine, said Lady Catherine, Lady Catherine have given Lady Catherine a treasure.’  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER XXIX.   [Illustration]  him's triumph, in consequence of asked, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of Lady Catherine to him's wondering visitors, and of letting his wondering visitors see Lady Catherine's civility towards him and him's wife, was exactly what him had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as him knew not how to admire enough .  “I confess,” said I, “that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from I's knowledge of her Ladyship’s's affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that us should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after us's arrival?”  “I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied I, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which I's situation in life has allowed I to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”  Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but us's visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing us in what us were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower us.  When the ladies  were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,--  “Do not make Elizabeth,-- uneasy, he's , about Elizabeth,--'s apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes Lady Catherine and daughter. he would advise Elizabeth,-- merely to put on whatever of Elizabeth,--'s clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of Elizabeth,-- for being simply dressed. Lady Catherine likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.”  While herself and daughter were dressing, he came two or three times to herself and daughter's different doors, to recommend herself and daughter's being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for Lady Catherine's dinner. Such formidable accounts of Lady Catherine, and Lady Catherine's manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company; and Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company looked forward to Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company's introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company's father had done to her father's presentation at St. James’s.  As the weather was fine, herself and daughter had a pleasant walk of about h alf a mile across the park. Every park has Every park's beauty and Every park's prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though Elizabeth could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by Mr. Collins's enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and Mr. Collins's relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.  When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail Elizabeth. Elizabeth had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke Elizabeth awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank Elizabeth thought Elizabeth could witness without trepidation.  From the hall, they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine, Lady Catherine's daughter, and Mrs. Jenkins on were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with Mrs. Collins's husband that the office of introduction should be Mrs. Collins, the office of introduction was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which her husband would have thought necessary.  In spite of having been at St. James’s, her husband was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding her husband, that her husband had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take her husband's seat without saying a word; and her husband's daughter, frightened almost out of his daughter's senses, sat on the edge of his daughter's chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found Elizabeth quite equal to the scene, and could observe them composedly. Her Ladyship was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her Ladyship's air was not conciliating, nor was Her Ladyship's manner of receiving them such as to make Her Ladyship's forget them's inferior rank. Her Ladyship was not rendered formidable by s ilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked she's self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, Elizabeth’s believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what Mr. Wickham had represented.  When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment Elizabeth’s soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth’s turned Elizabeth’s's eyes on Lady Catherine, Elizabeth’s could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at Lady Catherine being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: Miss de Bourgh's features, though not plain, were insignificant; and Miss de Bourgh spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what Miss de Bourgh said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before Miss de Bourgh's eyes.  After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the vi ew, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that its was much better worth looking at in the summer.  The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as Mr. Collins had likewise foretold, Mr. Collins took Mr. Collins's seat at the bottom of the table, by Lady Catherine's desire, and looked as if Mr. Collins felt that life could furnish nothing greater. Mr. Collins carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by Mr. Collins, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear's son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to their. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but Elizabeth was seated be tween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and Miss de Bourgh said not a word to Lady Catherine all the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing Miss de Bourgh to try some other dish and fearing Miss de Bourgh was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.  When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which Lady Catherine did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering Lady Catherine's opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that Lady Catherine was not used to have Lady Catherine's judgment controverted. Lady Catherine inquired into tween Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave tween Charlotte a great deal of advice as to the management of Charlotte’s domestic concerns; told tween Charlotte how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as tween Charlotte, and instructed tween Charlotte as to the care of tween Charlotte's cows and tween Charlotte's poultry. Elizabeth found that  nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish this great lady’s with an occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of this great lady’s's discourse with Mrs. Collins, this great lady’s addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to ElizabethMrs. Collins. this great lady’s asked Elizabeth at different times how many sisters Elizabeth had, whether they were older or younger than Elizabeth, whether any of they were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage Elizabeth's father kept, and what had been Elizabeth's mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of this great lady’s's questions, but answered her questions very composedly. this great lady’s then observed,--  “her father's estate is entailed on Mrs. Collins, this great lady’s think? For Elizabeth's sake,” turning to Charlotte, “this great lady’s am glad of entailed; but otherwise this great lady’s see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought n ecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, you?”  “A little.”  “Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. we's instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try Our instrument some day. Do you's sisters play and sing?”  “One of your sisters does.”  “Why did not we learn? we ought we to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and The Miss Webbs's father has not so good an income as you. Do you draw?you  “No, not at all.”  “What, none of we?”  “Not one.”  “That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. you's mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”  “Your mother would have no objection, but their father hates London.”  “Has you's governess left you?”  “We never had any governess.”  “No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to you's education.”  you could hardly help smiling, as sh e assured her that had not been the case.  “Then who taught e? who attended to e? Without a governess, e must have been neglected.”  “Compared with some families, e believe we were; but such of we as wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle certainly might.”  “Ay, no doubt: but chose is what a governess will prevent; and if e had known e's mother, e should have advised your mother most strenuously to engage one. e always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give steady and regular instruction. It is wonderful how many families e have been the means of supplying in that way. e am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through e's means; and it was but the other day that e recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to e, and the family  are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell Mrs. Collins of Lady Metcalfe’s calling yesterday to thank I? Lady Metcalfe’s finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘I,’ said Lady Metcalfe’s, ‘I have given Lady Metcalfe’s a treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, your?”  “Yes, I, all.”  “all What, all five out at once? Very odd! And your only the second. The younger ones out before the elder are married! your younger sisters must be very young?”  “Yes, your's youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _my youngest_ is full young to be much in company. But really, I, your think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that younger sisters should not have younger sisters's share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! your think kept would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”  “Upon I's word,” said I, “your give your's opinion very decided ly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”  “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied your, smiling, “your Ladyship can hardly expect your to own it.”  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and your suspected your to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.  “your cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore your need not conceal your's age.”  “your am not one-and-twenty.”  When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up Mrs. Jenkinson's party. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins's table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to quadrille, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed Mrs. Jenkinson's fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little li ght. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of Lady Catherine. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything Lady Catherine said, thanking Lady Catherine for every fish Mr. Collins won, and apologizing if Mr. Collins thought Mr. Collins won too many. Sir William did not say much. Sir William was storing Sir William's memory with anecdotes and noble names.  When Lady Catherine and Lady Catherine's daughter had played as long as Lady Catherine and her daughter chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mr. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather The party were to have on the morrow. From these instructions The party were summoned by the arrival of the carriage; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William, The party departed. As soon as The party had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by Elizabeth's cousin to give Elizabeth's opinion o f all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But she's commendation, though costing she some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins was very soon obliged to take she's praise into Mr. Collins's own hands.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXX.   [Illustration]  Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but Sir William's visit was long enough to convince Sir William of Sir William's daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of his daughter’s possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted Mr. Collins's mornings to driving Sir William out in Sir William's gig, and showing Sir William the country: but when Sir William went away, the whole family returned to the whole family's usual employments, and his daughter’s was thankful to find that the whole family did not see more of his daughter’s's cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by her cousin either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and l ooking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer The room in which the ladies sat for common use; The room in which the ladies sat was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but Elizabeth soon saw that Charlotte had an excellent reason for what Charlotte did, for his would undoubtedly have been much less in his's own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and Elizabeth gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.  From the drawing-room the ladies could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to his for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in Miss De Bourgh's phaeton, which his never failed coming to inform the ladies of, though it happened almost every day. Miss De Bourgh not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.  Very few days passed in which his ns did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which ns's wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, Elizabeth could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her Ladyship's observation that was passing in the room during these visits. her Ladyship examined into they's employments, looked at they's work, and advised they to do their work differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if her Ladyship accepted any refreshment, seemed to do accepted only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for Mrs. Collins’s's family.  Elizabeth soon perceived, that though her Ladyship was not in the commission of the peace for the county, her Ladyship was a most active magistrate in her Ladyship's own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her Ladyship by Mrs. Collins’s; and whenever any of the cottag ers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their's complaints, and scold their into harmony and plenty.  [Illustration:       “he never failed to inform them” ]  The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond Their reach. This, however, was no evil to she, and upon the whole she spent she's time comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. she's favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged tha t side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where herself felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.  In this quiet way the first fortnight of herself's visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding Easter was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. herself had heard, soon after herself's arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were not many of herself's acquaintance whom herself did not prefer, Mr. Darcy's coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important parties, and herself might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on Mr. Darcy were, by Mr. Darcy's behaviour to Mr. Darcy's cousin, for whom Mr. Darcy was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of Mr. Darcy in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that Mr. Darcy had already been frequently see n by Miss Lucas and Miss Lucas.  His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for His was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have  [Illustration:  “The gentlemen accompanied His.”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  the earliest assurance of His arrival; and, after making His's bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning His hastened to Rosings to pay His's respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with Mr. Darcy a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of Mr. Darcy's uncle, Lord ----; and, to the great surprise of all the party, when His returned, The gentlemen accompanied His. Charlotte had seen them from Charlotte's husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour the girls might expect, adding,--  “Charlotte may thank you, you, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come s o soon to wait upon me.”  Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards their entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as Mr. Darcy had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid Mr. Darcy's compliments, with Mr. Darcy's usual reserve, to Elizabeth; and whatever might be Mr. Darcy's feelings towards Elizabeth, met Elizabeth with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely courtesied to Mr. Darcy, without saying a word.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way entered into conversation directly, with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way's cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Elizabeth, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his cousin's civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of  her family. her answered him in the usual way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--  “her's eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have him never happened to see My eldest sister there?”  her was perfectly sensible that him never had: but her wished to see whether him would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and her thought him looked a little confused as him answered that him had never been so fortunate as to meet My eldest sister. The subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.     [Illustration:  “At Church” ]     CHAPTER XXXI.   [Illustration]  him's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that him must add considerably to the pleasure of the ladies all's engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before the ladies all received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house visitors could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or Lady Catherine's daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.  The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Lady Catherine received they civilly, but it was plain that they's company was by no means so acceptable as when Lady Catherine could get nobody else; and Lady Catherine was, in fact, almost engrossed by Lady Catherine's nephews, speaking to her nephews, especially to Mr. Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see they: anything was a welcome relief to Colonel Fitzwilliam at Rosings; and her daughter had, moreover, caught Colonel Fitzwilliam's fancy very much. Colonel Fitzwilliam now seated Colonel Fitzwilliam by Mrs. Collins’s, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshir e, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. _Mr. Darcy's_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards they with a look of curiosity; and that Lady Catherine herself, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for Lady Catherine herself did not scruple to call out,--  “What is that you are saying, you? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Elizabeth? Let Lady Catherine herself hear what it is.”  “they were talking of music, Lady Catherine herself,” said you, when no longer able to avoid a reply.  “Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects you's delight. you must have you's share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, you suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than you, or a better natural taste. If you had ever learnt, you should have been a g reat proficient. And so would Anne, if Anne's health had allowed Anne to apply. I am confident that Anne would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”  Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of Georgiana's proficiency.  “I am very glad to hear such a good account of Georgiana,” said I; “and pray tell Georgiana from I, that Georgiana cannot expect to excel, if Georgiana does not practise a great deal.”  “Darcy assure I, I,” Darcy replied, “that Georgiana does not need such advice. Georgiana practises very constantly.”  “So much the better. practises cannot be done too much; and when Darcy next write to Georgiana, Darcy shall charge Georgiana not to neglect it on any account. Darcy often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. Darcy have told Miss Bennet several times, that Miss Bennet will never play really well, unless Miss Bennet practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, Mrs. Collins is very welcome, as Darcy have often told Mrs. Collins, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part of the house.”  you looked a little ashamed of you's aunt’s ill-breeding, and made no answer.  When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded She of having promised to play to Colonel Fitzwilliam; and She sat down directly to the instrument. Colonel Fitzwilliam drew a chair near She. his aunt’s listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to his aunt’s's ; till you walked away from his aunt’s, and moving with you's usual deliberation towards the pianoforte, stationed you so as to command a full view of She's countenance. She saw what you was doing, and at the first convenient pause turned to you with an arch smile, and said,--  “you mean to frighten She, you, by coming in all this state to hear She. But She will not be alarmed, though She _does_ play so well. There is a stubbornness about She that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. She's courage always rises  with every attempt to intimidate me.”  “I shall not say that me are mistaken,” I replied, “because me could not really believe I to entertain any design of alarming me; and I have had the pleasure of me's acquaintance long enough to know, that me find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact, are not me's own.”  me laughed heartily at this picture of me, and said to I, “I's cousin will give I a very pretty notion of me, and teach I not to believe a word me say. me am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose me's real character, in a part of the world where me had hoped to pass me off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in Mr. Darcy to mention all that Mr. Darcy knew to me's disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give Mr. Darcy leave to say, very impolitic too--for mention is provoking Mr. Darcy to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock Mr. Darcy's relations to hear.”  “me am not afraid of  you,” said he, smilingly.  “Pray let me hear what he have to accuse him of,” cried me. “me should like to know how him behaves among strangers.”  “me shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The first time of he's ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, me must know, was at a ball--and at a ball, what do you think him did? him danced only four dances! he am sorry to pain me, but so it was. him danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to he's certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. you, you cannot deny the fact.”  “you had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond you's own party.”  “True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, me, what do you play next? you's fingers wait me's orders.”  “Perhaps,” said you, “you should have judged better had you sought an introduction, but you am ill-qualified to recommend you to strangers.”  “Shall we ask yo ur cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still addressing ur cousin. “Shall we ask ur cousin why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend ur cousin to strangers?”  “ur cousin can answer Elizabeth's question,” said ur cousin, “without applying to ur cousin. It is because ur cousin will not give ur cousin the trouble.”  “I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said I, “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch those I have never seen before's tone of conversation, or appear interested in those I have never seen before's concerns, as I often see done.”  “Elizabeth's fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which Elizabeth see so many women’s do. My fingers have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then Elizabeth have always supposed it to be Elizabeth's own fault--because Elizabeth would not take the trouble of practising. It is not that Elizabeth do not believe _My fingers as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”  D arcy smiled and said, “arcy are perfectly right. arcy have employed arcy's time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing arcy can think anything wanting. We neither of We perform to strangers.”  Here We were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what We were talking of. arcy immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,--  “arcy would not play at all amiss if arcy practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. arcy has a very good notion of fingering, though arcy's taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne’s would have been a delightful performer, had Anne’s's health allowed Anne’s to learn.”  arcy looked at arcy, to see how cordially arcy assented to Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of's praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could arcy discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of arcy's behaviour to Miss De Bourgh arcy derived this comfort for Miss De Bourgh, that arcy might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had her been his relation.  Lady Catherine continued Lady Catherine's remarks on her's performance, mixing with her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance many instructions on execution and taste. her received her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till Lady Catherine's carriage was ready to take them all home.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXXII.   [Illustration]  her was sitting by her the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when her was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As her had heard no carriage, her thought a visitor not unlikely to be Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her's half-finished letter, that her might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her's very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.  Mr. Darcy seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apol ogized for his intrusion, by letting her know that his had understood all the ladies to be within.  They then sat down, and when her's inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency recollecting _when_ her had seen his last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what his would say on the subject of their hasty departure, her observed,--  “How very suddenly their quitted Netherfield last November, his! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see their after Mr. Bingley so soon; for, if her recollect right, Mr. Bingley went but the day before. Mr. Bingley and Mr. Bingley's sisters were well, her hope, when her left London?”  “Perfectly so, her thank her.”  her found that her was to receive no other answer; and, after a short pause, added,--  “her think her have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?”  “her have never heard Mr. Bingley say so;  but it is probable that he may spend very little of he's time there in future. he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.”  “If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, he did not take the place so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for he's own, and we must expect he to keep or quit the place on the same principle.”  “I should not be surprised,” said I, “if he were to give the place up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.”  I made no answer. I was afraid of talking longer of I's ; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to I.  I took the hint and soon began with, “the place seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to the place when he first came to Huns ford.”  “I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed she's kindness on a more grateful object.”  “Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in Mr. Collins's choice of a wife.”  “Yes, indeed; Mr. Collins's friends may well rejoice in Mr. Collins's having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted Mr. Collins, or have made Mr. Collins happy if they had. she has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider she marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. she seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for she.”  “It must be very agreeable to she to be settled within so easy a distance of she's own family and friends.”  “An easy distance do I call it? it is nearly fifty miles.”  “And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”  “I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match,” cried I. “I should never hav e said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ Mrs. Collins's family.”  “said is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”  As I spoke there was a sort of smile, which your fancied your understood; I must be supposing your to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and your blushed as your answered,--  “your do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near a woman's family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case _here_. her family have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and your am persuaded your's would not call Mrs. Collins _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.”  I drew I's chair a little towards your, and said, “_your_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.”  You looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; The gentleman drew back The gentleman's chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over a newspaper, said, in a colder voice,--  “Are You pleased with Kent?”  A short dialogue on the subject of Kent ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and Charlotte's sister, just returned from Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk's walk. The _tête-à-tête_ surprised Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk. The gentleman related the mistake which had occasioned The gentleman's intruding on You, and, after sitting a few minutes longer, without saying much to anybody, went away.  [Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  “What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as The gentleman was gone. “Charlotte's , The gentleman must be in love with You, or The gentleman would never have called on us in this familiar way.”  But when You told of The gentleman's silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's  wishes, to be the case; and, after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to the Parsonage, or of the people who lived in the Parsonage, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. the two cousins called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by the two cousins's aunt. It was plain to them all that his came because his had pleasure in them all's society, a persuasion which of course recommended his still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by Elizabeth's own satisfaction in being with his, as well as by his's evident admiration, of Elizabeth's former favourite, George Wickham; and though, in com paring them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed Colonel Fitzwilliam’s might have the best informed mind.  But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult to understand. came could not be for society, as Mr. Darcy frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening Mr. Darcy's lips; and when Mr. Darcy did speak, speak seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy seldom appeared really animated. she knew not what to make of Mr. Darcy. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s's occasionally laughing at Colonel Fitzwilliam’s's stupidity proved that Colonel Fitzwilliam’s was generally different, which she's own knowledge of Colonel Fitzwilliam’s could not have told she; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of love she's friend Eliza, she set she seriously to work to find it out: she watched Colonel Fitzwilliam’s whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever Colonel Fitzwilliam’s came to Hunsford; but without much success. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s certainly looked at he r friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. that look was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in that look, and sometimes that look seemed nothing but absence of mind.  she had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of Elizabeth's being partial to Elizabeth, but Elizabeth always laughed at the possibility of his being partial to her; and she did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in she's opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all Elizabeth's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose Elizabeth to be in she's power.  In she's kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned Elizabeth marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. Colonel Fitzwilliam was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: Colonel Fitzwilliam certainly admired Elizabeth, and Colonel Fitzwilliam's situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and Mr. Darcy's cousin could have none at all.     [Illustration: “On  looking up”]     CHAPTER XXXIII.   [Illustration]  More than once did Elizabeth, in Elizabeth's ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring Mr. Darcy where no one else was brought; and, to prevent the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought's ever happening again, took care to inform Mr. Darcy, at first, that the park was a favourite haunt of Elizabeth. How the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought did, and even the third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but Mr. Darcy actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with Elizabeth. Mr. Darcy never said a great deal, nor did Elizabeth give Elizabeth the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck Elizabeth in the course of their third rencounter that Mr. Darcy was asking some odd unconnected questions--about Elizabeth's pleasure in being at Hunsford, Elizabeth's love of solitary walks, and Elizabeth's opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happine ss; and that in speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever her came into Kent again her would be staying _there_ too. he's words seemed to imply be. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in he's thoughts? her supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and her was quite glad to find her at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.  her was engaged one day, as her walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane’s had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by he, her saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away Jane’s last letter immediately, and forcing a smile, her said,--  “her did not know before that Colonel Fitzwilliam ever walked this way.”  “Colonel Fitzwilliam have been making the tour of the park,” Colonel Fitzwilliam replied, “as Colonel Fitzwilliam generally do every year, and intended to close the tour of the park with a call at  the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?”  “No, you should have turned in a moment.”  And accordingly you did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.  “Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said you.  “Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But you am at Darcy's disposal. Darcy arranges the business just as Darcy pleases.”  “And if not able to please Darcy in the arrangement, Darcy has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. you do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what Darcy likes than Darcy.”  “Darcy likes to have Darcy's own way very well,” replied you. “But so we all do. It is only that Darcy has better means of having his own way than many others, because Darcy is rich, and many others are poor. you speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.”  “In you's opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you be en prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”  “These are home questions--and perhaps you cannot say that you have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, you may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where Younger sons like.”  “Unless where Younger sons like women of fortune, which you think Younger sons very often do.”  “Our habits of expense make Our too dependent, and there are not many in you's rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.”  “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for Elizabeth?” and Elizabeth coloured at the idea; but, recovering Elizabeth, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, Elizabeth suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”  you answered Elizabeth in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make you fancy Elizabeth's affected with what had passed, Elizabeth soon afterwar ds said,--  “ds imagine your cousin brought your down with your cousin chiefly for the sake of having somebody at your cousin's disposal. ds wonder your cousin does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, your cousin's sister does as well for the present; and, as his sister is under your cousin's sole care, your cousin may do what your cousin likes with his sister.”  “No,” said your, “that is an advantage which your cousin must divide with your. your am joined with your cousin in the guardianship of his sister.”  “Are your, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do your make? Does his sister give your much trouble? Young ladies of his sister's age are sometimes a little difficult to manage; and if his sister has the true Darcy spirit, his sister may like to have his sister's own way.”  As ds spoke, ds observed your looking at ds earnestly; and the manner in which your immediately asked ds why ds supposed his sister likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced ds that ds had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. ds directly replied,--  “your need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say her is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. her is a very great favourite with some ladies of I's acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard I say that I know some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.”  “I know some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley a little. some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley's brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike man--Their brother is a great friend of Darcy’s.”  “Oh yes,” said I drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Miss Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of Miss Bingley.”  “Care of Miss Bingley! Yes, I really believe Darcy’s _does_ take care of Miss Bingley in those points where Miss Bingley most wants care. From something that Darcy’s told I in our journey hither, I have reason to think Miss Bingley very much indebted to Darcy’s. But I ought to beg Darcy’s's pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Miss Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”  “What is it I mean?”  “It is a circumstance which Darcy’s of course could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to her's family it would be an un pleasant thing.”  “You may depend upon You's not mentioning it.”  “And remember that You have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What Bingley told You was merely this: that Bingley congratulated Bingley on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars; and You only suspected it to be Bingley from believing Bingley the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”  “Did Mr. Darcy give You Mr. Darcy's reasons for this interference?”  “You understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.”  “And what arts did Mr. Darcy use to separate them?”  “Mr. Darcy did not talk to You of Mr. Darcy's own arts,” said You, smiling. “Mr. Darcy only told You what You have now told You.”  You made no answer, and walked on, You's heart swelling with indignation. After watching You a little, You asked You why You was so thoughtful.  “You am thinking of  what you have been telling me,” said me. “you's cousin’s conduct does not suit me's feelings. Why was Your cousin’s to be the judge?”  “me are rather disposed to call Your cousin’s's interference officious?”  “me do not see what right Your cousin’s had to decide on the propriety of Your cousin’s's inclination; or why, upon Your cousin’s's own judgment alone, Your cousin’s was to determine and direct in what manner Your cousin’s was to be happy. But,” me continued, recollecting me, “as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn Your cousin’s. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.”  “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said you; “but That is lessening the honour of Your cousin’s's triumph very sadly.”  This was spoken jestingly, but This appeared to me so just a picture of Your cousin’s, that me would not trust me with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into me's own room, as soon as they's visitor le ft them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom she could have such boundless influence. That she had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Mr. Bingley the principal design and arrangement of the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane. If Mr. Bingley's own vanity, however, did not mislead Mr. Bingley, _Mr. Bingley_ was the cause--Mr. Bingley's pride and caprice were the cause--of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. Mr. Bingley had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil Mr. Bingley might have inflicted.  “There were some very strong objections against she,” were Colonel Fitzwilliam’s words; and some very strong objections against the lady probably were, she having one uncle who was a country attorne y, and another who was in business in London.  “To Jane Jane herself,” Jane herself exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as Jane herself is! Jane herself's understanding excellent, Jane herself's mind improved, and Jane herself's manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against Jane herself's father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When Jane herself thought of Jane herself's mother, indeed, Jane herself's confidence gave way a little; but Jane herself would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, Jane herself was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in Mr. Darcy himself's friend’s connections than from his friend’s's want of sense; and Jane herself was quite decided, at last, that Mr. Darcy himself had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for Mr. Darcy himself's sister.  The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache; and it g rew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her's cousins to Rosings, where her cousins were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that her was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her's husband from pressing her; but Mrs. Collins could not conceal Mrs. Collins's apprehension of her's being rather displeased by her staying at home.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXXIV.   [Illustration]  When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate Elizabeth as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for Elizabeth's employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to Elizabeth since Jane being in Kent. all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize Jane's style, and which, proceeding  from the serenity of a mind at ease with a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards everyone, and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery Mr. Darcy’s had been able to inflict gave Elizabeth a keener sense of Elizabeth's sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that Mr. Darcy’s's visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater that in less than a fortnight Elizabeth should Elizabeth be with her sister’s again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of Elizabeth's spirits, by all that affection could do.  Elizabeth could not think of Mr. Darcy’s's leaving Kent without remembering that Mr. Darcy’s's cousin was to go with Mr. Darcy’s; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that Colonel Fitzwilliam had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as Colonel Fitzwilliam was, Elizabeth did not mean to be unhappy about Colonel Fitzwilliam.  While settling this point, Elizabeth was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell; and Elizabeth's spirits wer e a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after e. But the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her was soon banished, and e's spirits were very differently affected, when, to e's utter amazement, e saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In a hurried manner Mr. Darcy immediately began an inquiry after e's health, imputing Mr. Darcy's visit to a wish of hearing that e were better. e answered Mr. Darcy with cold civility. Mr. Darcy sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room. e was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, Mr. Darcy came towards e in an agitated manner, and thus began:--  “In vain have Mr. Darcy struggled. It will not do. Mr. Darcy's feelings will not be repressed. e must allow Mr. Darcy to tell e how ardently Mr. Darcy admire and love e.”  e's astonishment was beyond expression. e stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This Mr. Darcy considered sufficient encouragement, a nd the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed. he spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. he's sense of her's inferiority, of her inferiority's being a degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend he's suit.  In spite of her's deeply-rooted dislike, her could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her's intentions did not vary for an instant, her was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till roused to resentment by he's subsequent language, her lost all compassion in anger. her tried, however, to compose her to answer he with patience, when he should have done. he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all he's ende avours he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing he's hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of he's hand. As he said this her could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but he's countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her's cheeks and her said,--  “In such cases as this, it is, her believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally the sentiments avowed may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if her could _feel_ gratitude, her would now thank you. But her cannot--her have never desired you's good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed your good opinion most unwillingly. her am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and her hope will be of short duration. The feelings which you tell her have long prevented the acknowledgment of you's r egard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.”  Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face's eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her's words with no less resentment than surprise. Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face's complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face's mind was visible in every feature. Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face's lips till Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face believed Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face to have attained the appearance of composure. The pause was to her's feelings dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face said,--  “And this is all the reply which Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face am to have the honour of expecting! Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”  “her might as well inquire,” replied her, “why, with so evident a design of offending and insulting her, Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face chose to tell her that Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face liked her against Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face's will, against Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face's reason, and even against Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face's character? Was not tell some excuse  for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not I's own feelings decided against You, had my own feelings been indifferent, or had my own feelings even been favourable, do You think that any consideration would tempt I to accept You?”  As I pronounced these words, You changed colour; but changed was short, and You listened without attempting to interrupt I while I continued,--  “I have every reason in the world to think ill of You. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part You acted _there_. You dare not, You cannot deny that You have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to the world's derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them in misery of the acutest kind.”  I paused, and saw with no slight indignation that You was l istening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. him even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.  “Can him deny that him have done it?” her repeated.  With assumed tranquillity him then replied, “him have no wish of denying that him did everything in him's power to separate him from her's sister, or that him rejoice in him's success. Towards _him_ him have been kinder than towards him.”  her disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but this civil reflection's meaning did not escape, nor was this civil reflection likely to conciliate her.  “But it is not merely this affair,” her continued, “on which her's dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place, her's opinion of him was decided. him's character was unfolded in the recital which her received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can him have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can him here defend him? or under what misrepresentation can him here impose upon others?”  “him take an eag er interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.  “Who that knows what that gentleman’s's misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in that gentleman’s?”  “his misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.”  “And of Darcy's infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “Darcy have reduced that gentleman’s to that gentleman’s's present state of poverty--comparative poverty. Darcy have withheld the advantages which Darcy must know to have been designed for that gentleman’s. Darcy have deprived the best years of that gentleman’s's life of that independence which was no less that gentleman’s's due than that gentleman’s's desert. Darcy have done all this! and yet Darcy can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.”  “And this,” cried Darcy, as Darcy walked with quick steps across the room, “is Elizabeth's opinion of Darcy! this is the estimation in which Elizabeth hold Darcy! Darcy thank Elizabeth for explaining it so fully. Darcy's faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added Darcy, stopp ing in his walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been overlooked, had not her's pride been hurt by his's honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented his's forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had his, with greater policy, concealed his's struggles, and flattered her into the belief of his's being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is his's abhorrence. Nor am his ashamed of the feelings his related. the feelings I related were natural and just. Could her expect his to rejoice in the inferiority of her's connections?--to congratulate his on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath his's own?”  her felt her growing more angry every moment; yet her tried to the utmost to speak with composure when her said,--  “his are mistaken, his, if his suppose that the mode of his's declaration affected her in any other way than as the mode of your declaration spared her  the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.”  I saw you start at this; but you said nothing, and I continued,--  “you could not have made I the offer of you's hand in any possible way that would have tempted I to accept the offer of your hand.”  Again you's astonishment was obvious; and you looked at I with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. I went on,--  “From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of I's acquaintance with you, you's manners impressing I with the fullest belief of you's arrogance, you's conceit, and you's selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”  “I have said quite enough, I. you perfectly comprehend I's feelings, and have now only to be  ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive my for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my's best wishes for your's health and happiness.”  And with these words my hastily left the room, and your heard my the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of your's mind was now painfully great. your knew not how to support your, and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. your's astonishment, as your reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That your should receive an offer of marriage from my! that my should have been in love with your for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry your in spite of all the objections which had made my prevent my's friend’s marrying my's sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in my's own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But my's pride, his pride, my's shameless avowal of what my  had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though his could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner which his had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his's cruelty towards whom his had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his's attachment had for a moment excited.  She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made She feel how unequal She was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried She away to She's room.     [Illustration:  “Hearing herself called” ]     CHAPTER XXXV.   [Illustration]  She awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed She's eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, She resolved soon after breakfast to indulge She in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to She's favourite walk, when the recollection of  Mr. Darcy’s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, her turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and her soon passed one of the gates into the ground.  After walking two or three times along that part of the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road, her was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which her had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. her was on the point of continuing her's walk, when her caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park: a gentleman was moving that way; and fearful of a gentleman's being Mr. Darcy’s, her was directly retreating. But a gentleman was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her's name. her had turned away; but on hearing her called, though in a voice which proved it to  be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. Mr. Darcy had by that time reached the gate also; and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, “Mr. Darcy have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of meeting Mr. Darcy. Will Mr. Darcy do Mr. Darcy the honour of reading a letter, which she instinctively took?” and then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.  With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, she opened a letter, which she instinctively took, and to she still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand was likewise full. Pursuing she's way along the lane, she then began it. a letter, which she instinctively took was dated from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--  “Be not alarmed, she, on receiving a letter, which she instinctively took, by the apprehension of a letter, which she instinctively took's containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to  you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling I, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not I's character required this letter to be written and read. you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand you's attention; you's feelings, I know, will bestow your attention unwillingly, but I demand your attention of you's justice.  “Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to I's charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from you's sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of I's youth, the acknowledged favourite of I's father, a young man  who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect our patronage's exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of I's actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of my actions which is due to I, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred yours's elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of Bingley's feeling a serious attachment. I  had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that him's attentions to you's sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. him spoke of their marriage as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed him's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that him's partiality for your sister was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. your sister I also watched. your sister's look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that though your sister received him's attentions with pleasure, your sister did not invite his attentions by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in an error. you's superior knowledge of your sister must make an error probable. If it be so, if I have been misled b y such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of her's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her's temper, her's heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her's indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that I's investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by I's hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished be; I believed be on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished be in reason. I's objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in I's own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to I's as to I. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myse lf endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by your mother’s, by your's three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your's father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend your. But amidst your's concern for the defects of your's nearest relations, and your's displeasure at this representation of the defects of your nearest relations, let it give your consolation to consider that to have conducted your so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on your and your's eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of you and your eldest sister. me will only say, farther, that from what passed that evening me's opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve me's friend from what me esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is now to be explained. He's sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited with I's own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching His sisters’'s , our shortly resolved on joining He directly in London. our accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to He the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced the certain evils of such a choice earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed He's determination, I do not suppose that this remonstrance would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had this remonstrance not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of you's sister’s indifference. He had before believed your sister’s to return He's affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard. But He has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on m y judgment than on his own. To convince his, therefore, that his had deceived his was no very difficult point. To persuade his against returning into Hertfordshire, when deceived had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame I for having done thus much. There is but one part of I's conduct, in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; but one part of my conduct, in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from his your sister’s being in town. I knew your sister’s being in town I, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but your sister’s's is even yet ignorant of your sister’s being in town. That they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his's regard did not appear to I enough extinguished for his to see your sister’s without some danger. Perhaps conceal, was beneath I. conceal is done, however, and conceal was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your's feelings, it was unk nowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, me have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, me can only refute that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham by laying before you the whole of Mr. Wickham's connection with me's family. Of what Mr. Wickham has _particularly_ accused me me am ignorant; but of the truth of what me shall relate me can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of Mr. Wickham's trust naturally inclined me's father to be of service to Mr. Wickham; and on George Wickham, who was Mr. Wickham's godson, Mr. Wickham's kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. my father supported Mr. Wickham at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as Mr. Wickham's own father, always poor from the extravagance of Mr. Wickham's wife, would have been unable to give Mr. Wickham a gentleman’s education. M y father was not only fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, y father had also the highest opinion of this young man’s, and hoping the church would be this young man’s's profession, intended to provide for this young man’s in the church. As for myself, it is many, many years since myself first began to think of this young man’s in a very different manner. The vicious propensities, the want of principle, which this young man’s was careful to guard from the knowledge of this young man’s's best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with this young man’s, and who had opportunities of seeing this young man’s in unguarded moments, which his best friend could not have. Here again myself shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which this young man’s has created, a suspicion of the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created's nature shall not prevent myself from unfolding this young man’s's real character. It adds even another motive. myself's died about five years ago; and y father's attachment to this young man’s was to the last so steady, that in y father's will y father particularly  recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his's profession might allow, and if his took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his's as soon as a valuable family living became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. his's own father did not long survive me; and within half a year from these events his wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, his hoped me should not think it unreasonable for his to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which his could not be benefited. his had some intention, his added, of studying the law, and me must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. me rather wished than believed his to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his's proposal. me knew that his ought not to be a clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. his resigned all claim to assistance in the chu rch, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of he to invite he to Pemberley, or admit he's society in town. In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but he's studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint, he's life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of he; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for he, he applied to I again by letter for the presentation. he's circumstances, he assured I, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. he had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present he to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten I's  revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of this entreaty. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of His's circumstances--and His was doubtless as violent in His's abuse of me to others as in His's reproaches to me. After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How His lived, me know not. But last summer His was again most painfully obtruded on me's notice. me must now mention a circumstance which me would wish to forget me, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, me feel no doubt of You's secrecy. me's sister, who is more than ten years me's junior, was left to the guardianship of me's mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and me. About a year ago, My sister, who is more than ten years my junior was taken from school, and an establishment formed for My sister, who is more than ten years my junior in London; and last summer My sister, who is more than ten years my junior went with the lady who presided over an establishment to Ramsgate; and thither also wen t Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between Mr. Wickham and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived's connivance and aid Mr. Wickham so far recommended Mr. Wickham to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of Mr. Wickham's kindness to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child as a child, that Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child was persuaded to believe Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child in love and to consent to an elopement. Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child was then but fifteen, which must be Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child's excuse; and after stating Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child's imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of her imprudence to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before an elopement; and then Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending Mr. WickhamGeorgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , acknowledged the whole to I. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for I's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. WickhamMrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived  emoved from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but my cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging Mr. Wickham’s on my was a strong inducement. Mr. Wickham’s's revenge would have been complete indeed. This, my, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if my do not absolutely reject This as false, my will, my hope, acquit my henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham’s. my know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood, Mr. Wickham’s has imposed on my; but Mr. Wickham’s's success is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as my previously were of everything concerning either. Detection could not be in my's power, and suspicion certainly not in my's inclination. my may possibly wonder why all this was not told my last night. But my was not then master enough of my to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, my can appeal more particularly to the testimon y of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If my's abhorrence of _my_ should make _my's_ assertions valueless, my cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my's cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting my cousin, my shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in my's hands in the course of the morning. my will only add, God bless my.  “FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XXXVI.   [Illustration]  my, when Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father’s will gave my this letter, did not expect this letter to contain a renewal of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father’s will's offers, my had formed no expectation at all of this letter's contents. But such as its contents were, it may be well supposed how eagerly my went through its contents, and what a contrariety of emotion its contents excited. my's feelings as my read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did my first  understand that he believed any apology to be in he's power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began he's account of what had happened at Netherfield. she read with an eagerness which hardly left she's power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of heshe's . he's belief of she's sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and he's account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made she too angry to have any wish of doing he justice. he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied she; he's style was not penitent, but haughty. his style was all pride and insolence.  But when this subject was succeeded by he's account of Mr. Wickham--when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which, if true, m ust overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his's own history of his--her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. her wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “it must be false! it cannot be! it must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when her had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put the whole letter hastily away, protesting that her would not regard the whole letter, that her would never look in the whole letter again.  In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, her walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the whole letter was unfolded again; and collecting her as well as her could, her again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to his, and commanded her so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his's connection with the Pemberley  family was exactly what he had related he; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy's extent, agreed equally well with the late Mr. Darcy's own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What he had said of the living was fresh in she's memory; and as she recalled he's very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other, and, for a few moments, she flattered she that she's wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of he's resigning all pretensions to the living, of he's receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. she put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again sh e read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make Mr. Darcy’s entirely blameless throughout the whole.  The extravagance and general profligacy which Mr. Darcy’s scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked she; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. she had never heard of Mr. Darcy’s before Mr. Darcy’s's entrance into the ----shire militia, in which Mr. Darcy’s had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting Mr. Darcy’s accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of Mr. Darcy’s's former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what Mr. Darcy’s told  [Illustration:       “Meeting accidentally in Town”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  Mr. Darcy’s. As to Mr. Darcy’s's real character, had information been in she's power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. Mr. Darcy’s's countenance, voice, and manner,  had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which She would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But no such recollection befriended She. She could see him instantly before She, in every charm of air and address, but She could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which him's social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, She once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of him's designs on Mr. Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and She only the morning before; and at last She was referred for the  truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his's cousin’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to his, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of applying, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that his would never have hazarded such a proposal, if his had not been well assured of his cousin’s's corroboration.  she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and she in Wickham and herself's first evening at Mr. Philips’s. Many of Wickham's expressions were still fresh in she's memory. she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered the impropriety of such communications to a stranger had escaped she before. she saw the indelicacy of putting Wickham forward as Wickham had done, and the inconsistency of Wickham's professions with Wickham's conduct. she remembered that Wickham had boasted of having no fear of seein g Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _Mr. Darcy_ should stand Mr. Darcy's ground; yet Mr. Darcy had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, Mr. Darcy had told Mr. Darcy's story to no one but She; but that after the Netherfield family's removal, his story had been everywhere discussed; that Mr. Darcy had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though Mr. Darcy had assured She that respect for the father would always prevent Mr. Darcy's exposing Mr. Darcy.  How differently did everything now appear in which Mr. Darcy was concerned! Mr. Darcy's attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of She's fortune proved no longer the moderation of Mr. Darcy's wishes, but Mr. Darcy's eagerness to grasp at anything. Mr. Darcy's behaviour to She could now have had no tolerable motive: Mr. Darcy had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying Mr. Darcy's vanity by encouraging the preference which She believ ed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of his, she could not but allow that his, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his's blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as were his's manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought their much together, and given she a sort of intimacy with his's ways--seen anything that betrayed his to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke his of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his's own connections his was esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed his merit as a brother, and that she had often heard his speak so affectionately of his's sister as to prove his capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his's actions been what even Wickham represented his actions, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that frien dship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.  She grew absolutely ashamed of She. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could She think, without feeling that She had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.  “How despicably have She acted!” She cried. “I, who have prided She on She's discernment! I, who have valued She on She's abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of She's sister, and gratified She's vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had She been in love, She could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been She's folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, She have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were concerned. Till this moment, She never knew She.”  From She to Jane, from Jane to Mr. Bingley, She's thoughts were in a  line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient; and her read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could her deny that credit to Mr. Darcy’s's assertions, in one instance, which her had been obliged to give in the other? Mr. Darcy’s declared Mr. Darcy’s to have been totally unsuspicious of her's sister’s attachment; and her could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could her deny the justice of Mr. Darcy’s's description of her sister’s. her felt that her sister’s's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her sister’s's air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.  When her came to that part of the letter in which her sister’s's family were mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her's sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial; and the circumstances to which Mr. Darcy’s particularly alluded, as having passed a t the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his's mind than on hers.  The compliment to hers and hers's sister was not unfelt. The compliment to herself and her sister soothed, but The compliment to herself and her sister could not console hers for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of hers's family; and as hers considered that her sister's disappointment had, in fact, been the work of hers's nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of herself and her sister must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, hers felt depressed beyond anything hers had ever known before.  After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling hers, as well as hers could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of hers's long absence, made hers at length return home; and hers entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflection s as must make her unfit for conversation.  her was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her's absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her's return, and almost resolving to walk after her till her could be found. her could but just _affect_ concern in missing Colonel Fitzwilliam; her really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object. her could think only of her's letter.     [Illustration:  “His parting obeisance” ]     CHAPTER XXXVII.   [Illustration]  the two gentlemen from Rosings left Rosings the next morning; and His having been in waiting near the lodges, to make the two gentlemen from Rosings His parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of the two gentlemen from Rosings's appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings His then hastened to console Lady Catherine a nd her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that her Ladyship felt her Ladyship so dull as to make her Ladyship very desirous of having them all to dine with her Ladyship.  her daughter could not see her Ladyship without recollecting that, had her daughter chosen it, her daughter might by this time have been presented to her Ladyship as her Ladyship's future niece; nor could her daughter think, without a smile, of what her Ladyship's indignation would have been. “What would her Ladyship have said? how would her Ladyship have behaved?” were the questions with which her Ladyship amused her Ladyship.  Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “her Ladyship assure you, her Ladyship feel the diminution of the Rosings’ party exceedingly,” said her Ladyship; “her Ladyship believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as her Ladyship do. But her Ladyship am particularly attached to these young men; and know these young men to be so much attached to her Ladyship! these young men were excessively sorry to go! But so these young men always are. his rallied his's spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most a cutely--more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”  Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.  Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits; and immediately accounting for seemed Lady Catherine, by supposing that Miss Bennet did not like to go home again so soon, Lady Catherine added,--  “But if that is the case, Miss Bennet must write to Miss Bennet's mother to beg that Miss Bennet may stay a little longer. Mr. Collins will be very glad of Miss Bennet's company, Lady Catherine am sure.”  “Miss Bennet am much obliged to Lady Catherine for Lady Catherine's kind invitation,” replied Miss Bennet; “but it is not in Miss Bennet's power to accept your kind invitation. Miss Bennet must be in town next Saturday.”  “Why, at that rate, Miss Bennet will have been here only six weeks. Lady Catherine expected Miss Bennet to stay two months. Lady Catherine told Mr. Collins so before Miss Bennet came. There can be no occasion for Miss Bennet's going so soon. Miss Bennet could certainly spare Miss Bennet for another fortnight.”  “But Miss Bennet's father cannot. my father wrote  last week to hurry my return.”  [Illustration:  “Dawson”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  “Oh, your father, of course, may spare your, if your's mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if your will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my's power to take one of your as far as London, for my am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of your--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, my should not object to taking your, as your are neither of your large.”  “my are all kindness, my; but my believe we must abide by we's original plan.”  Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “my, my must send a servant with your. You know Lady Catherine always speak Lady Catherine's mind, and Lady Catherine cannot bear the idea of your travelling post by your. travelling is highly improper. my must contrive to send somebody. Lady Catherine have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young  women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to women's situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, my made a point of my niece Georgiana having two men-servants go with my niece Georgiana. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. my am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, You. my am glad it occurred to my to mention send; for it would really be discreditable to _You_ to let the young ladies go alone.”  “You's uncle is to send a servant for us.”  “Oh! My uncle! My uncle keeps a man-servant, does My uncle? my am very glad You have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall You change horses? Oh, Bromley, of course. If Bromley mention my's name at the Bell, Bromley will be attended to.”  my had many other questions to ask respecting us's journey; and as my did not answer many other questions to ask respecting their journey my attention was necessary--which You believed to be lucky f or her; or, with a mind so occupied, her might have forgotten where her was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever her was alone, her gave way to Reflection as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which her might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.  Mr. Darcy’s letter her was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. her studied every sentence; and her's feelings towards Mr. Darcy’s were at times widely different. When her remembered the style of Mr. Darcy’s's address, her was still full of indignation: but when her considered how unjustly her had condemned and upbraided Mr. Darcy’s, her's anger was turned against her; and Mr. Darcy’s's disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. Mr. Darcy’s's attachment excited gratitude, Mr. Darcy’s's general character respect: but her could not approve Mr. Darcy’s; nor could her for a moment repent her's refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see Mr. Darcy’s again. In her's own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation  and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. the unhappy defects of her family were hopeless of remedy. her's father, contented with laughing at the unhappy defects of her family, would never exert Her father to restrain the wild giddiness of Her father's youngest daughters; and her's mother, with manners so far from right her mother, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while Catherine and Lydia were supported by Catherine and Lydia's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, would scarcely give their a hearing. Catherine and Lydia were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, Catherine and Lydia would flirt with an officer; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, Catherine and Lydia would be going there for ever.  Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darc y’s explanation, by restoring y’s to all y’s's former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. y’s's affection was proved to have been sincere, and y’s's conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of y’s's confidence in Jane. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of Jane's own family!  When to these recollections was added the development of y’s's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for y’s to appear tolerably cheerful.  Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of y’s's stay as Their engagements at Rosings had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and y’s again inquired minutely into the particulars of Their's journey, gave Their directions as  to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought Maria obliged, on Maria's return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack Maria's trunk afresh.  When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished they a good journey, and invited they to come to Hunsford again next year; and Lady Catherine exerted Lady Catherine so far as to courtesy and hold out Lady Catherine's hand to they.     [Illustration:  “The elevation of his feelings.” ]     CHAPTER XXXVIII.   [Illustration]  On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and Mr. Collins took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which Mr. Collins deemed indispensably necessary.  “Mr. Collins know not, Elizabeth,” said Mr. Collins, “whether Mr. Collins has yet expressed Mr. Collins's sense of Elizabeth's kindness in coming to us; but Mr. Collins am very certain Elizabeth will not leave the house without receiving Mr. Collins thanks for it. The favour of Elizabeth's company has bee n much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to We's humble abode. We's plain manner of living, We's small rooms, and few domestics, and the little We see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like you; but I hope you will believe We grateful for the condescension, and that We have done everything in We's power to prevent you spending you's time unpleasantly.”  you was eager with you's thanks and assurances of happiness. you had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attention you had received, must make _you's_ feel the obliged. I was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,--  “It gives I the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed you's time not disagreeably. We have certainly done We's best; and most fortunately having it in We's power to introduce you to very superior society, and from We's connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the  humble home scene, I think we may flatter we that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing Our are. You see how continually Our are engaged there. In truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in this humble parsonage an object of compassion, while anyone abiding in it are sharers of Our's intimacy at Rosings.”  Words were insufficient for the elevation of I's feelings; and I was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.  “your may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, your. I flatter I, at least, that your will be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s's great attentions to Mrs. Collins your have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your r friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, you, that me can from me's heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. me's dear Charlotte and me have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between My dear Charlotte and I. My dear Charlotte and I seem to have been designed for each other.”  you could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that you firmly believed and rejoiced in me's domestic comforts. you was not sorry, however, to have the recital of his domestic comforts interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom his domestic comforts sprang. My dear Charlotte it was melancholy to leave My dear Charlotte to such society! But My dear Charlotte had chosen it with My dear Charlotte's eyes open; and though evidently regretting that My dear Charlotte's visitors were to go, My dear Charlotte did not seem to ask for compassion. My dear Charlotte's home and My dear Charlotte's housekeeping, My dear Charlotte's parish and My dear Charlotte's poultry, and all their depe ndent concerns, had not yet lost ndent concerns's charms.  At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, Mr. Collins was commissioning Elizabeth with Mr. Collins's best respects to all Elizabeth's family, not forgetting Mr. Collins's thanks for the kindness Mr. Collins had received at Longbourn in the winter, and Mr. Collins's compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. Mr. Collins then handed Elizabeth in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when Mr. Collins suddenly reminded they, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.  [Illustration:  “they had forgotten to leave any message” ]  “But,” Mr. Collins added, “Elizabeth will of course wish to have Elizabeth's humble respects delivered to the ladies of Rosings, with Elizabeth's grateful thanks for the ladies of Rosings's kindness to Elizabeth while Elizabeth have been here.”  Elizabeth made no  objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.  “Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!”  “A great many indeed,” said Maria's companion, with a sigh.  “we have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much her companion shall have to tell!”  her companion privately added, “And how much her companion shall have to conceal!”  we's journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of we's leaving Hunsford we reached Mr. Gardiner’s house, where we were to remain a few days.  Jane looked well, and her companion had little opportunity of studying Jane's spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her companion's aunt had reserved for we. But Jane was to go home with her companion, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.  It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that her companion could wait even for Longbourn, before  she told she's sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish her sister, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of she's own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate, and she's fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister further.     [Illustration:       “How nicely we are crammed in” ]     CHAPTER XXXIX.   [Illustration]  It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as the three young ladies drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was to meet the three young ladies, the three young ladies quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room  upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.  After welcoming These two girls's sisters, These two girls triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, “Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”  “And These two girls mean to treat their sisters,” added Lydia; “but their sisters must lend These two girls the money, for These two girls have just spent These two girls at the shop out there.” Then showing Lydia's purchases,--“Look here, Lydia have bought this bonnet. Lydia do not think this bonnet is very pretty; but Lydia thought Lydia might as well buy this bonnet as not. Lydia shall pull this bonnet to pieces as soon as Lydia get home, and see if Lydia can make this bonnet up any better.”  And when Lydia's abused this bonnet as ugly, Lydia added, with perfect unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when Lydia have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim this bonnet with fresh, Lydia think it will be very tolerable. Besides,  it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and the ----shire are going in a fortnight.”  “Are the ----shire, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.  “the ----shire are going to be encamped near Brighton; and Elizabeth do so want papa to take us all there for this summer! take would be such a delicious scheme, and Elizabeth dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!”  “Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_take_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us all at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”  “Now I have got some news for you,” said I, as you sat down to table. “What do you think? some news is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like.”  you looked at each other, and the waiter was tol d that he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--  “Ay, that is just like Lydia's formality and discretion. Lydia thought he must not hear, as if he cared! Lydia dare say he often hears worse things said than Lydia am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! Lydia am glad he is gone. Lydia never saw such a long chin in Lydia's life. Well, but now for Lydia's news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for he, is not it? There is no danger of dear Wickham's marrying Mary King--there’s for Lydia! Mary King is gone down to Mary King's uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. dear Wickham is safe.”  “And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.”  “Mary King is a great fool for going away, if Mary King liked dear Wickham.”  “But Lydia hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.  “Lydia am sure there is not on _dear Wickham's_. Lydia will answer for it, dear Wickham never cared three straws about Mary King. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?”  Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness o f _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than herself's own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!  As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and, after some contrivance, all, with all all's boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases, were seated in the carriage.  “How nicely all are crammed in!” cried Lydia’s. “Lydia’s am glad Lydia’s brought Lydia’s's bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now let all be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let all hear what has happened to all since all went away. Have all seen any pleasant men? Have all had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of all would have got a husband before all came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. Jane is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! I's aunt Phil ips wants you so to get husbands you can’t think. ips says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in taken. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Colonel Forster’s promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by-the-bye, Colonel Forster’s and me are _such_ friends!) and so Colonel Forster’s asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by Pen; and then, what do you think we did? we dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of dressed, but Colonel Forster’s and Colonel Forster’s, and Kitty and me, except me's aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of my aunt's gowns; and you cannot imagine how well Chamberlayne looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men  came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then the men soon found out what was the matter.”  With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse Lydia's companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as Elizabeth could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of him's name.  Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mrs. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,----  “Mrs. Bennet am glad Elizabeth are come back, Elizabeth.”  Their's party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects which occupied Their party in the dining-room: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the table, after the welfare and poultry of Lady Lucas's eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was dou bly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing the present fashions to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear Lydia.  “Oh, Mary,” said Lydia, “Lydia wish Mary had gone with us, for us had such fun! as us went along us drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and Lydia should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when us got to the George, Lydia do think us behaved very handsomely, for us treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if Mary would have gone, us would have treated Mary too. And then when us came away it was such fun! Lydia thought us never should have got into the coach. Lydia was ready to die of laughter. And then us were so merry all the way home! us talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us  ten miles off!”  To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from Mary, Mary's dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures. such pleasures would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But Mary confess such pleasures would have no charms for _Mary_. Mary should infinitely prefer a book.”  But of this answer my dear sister heard not a word. my dear sister seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.  In the afternoon my dear sister was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before the Miss Bennets were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason, too, for Elizabeth's opposition. Elizabeth dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid seeing as long as possible. The comfort to _Elizabeth's_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight the regiment’s were to go, and once gone, Elizabeth hoped there could be nothing m ore to plague her on his account.  her had not been many hours at home, before her found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her's parents. her saw directly that her's father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but her father's answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her's mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XL.   [Illustration]  her's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which Jane was concerned, and preparing Jane to be surprised, her related to Jane the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and her.  Jane's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of her appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other fee lings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered Mr. Darcy's sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend his sentiments; but still more was She grieved for the unhappiness which She's sister’s refusal must have given Mr. Darcy.  “Mr. Darcy's being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said She, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much His being so sure of succeeding must increase Mr. Darcy's disappointment.”  “Indeed,” replied her sister’s, “her sister’s am heartily sorry for Mr. Darcy; but Mr. Darcy has other feelings which will probably soon drive away Mr. Darcy's regard for her sister’s. her sister’s do not blame her sister’s, however, for refusing Mr. Darcy?”  “Blame her sister’s! Oh, no.”  “But her sister’s blame her sister’s for having spoken so warmly of Mr. Darcy?”  “No--her sister’s do not know that her sister’s were wrong in saying what her sister’s did.”  “But her sister’s _will_ know it, when her sister’s have told her sister’s what happened the very next day.”  her sister’s then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of the letter's contents as far as they concerned Mr. Darcy. What a stroke was this for poor Jane, who would willingly have gone through the world without b elieving that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to Darcy’s's feelings, capable of consoling Darcy’s for such discovery. Most earnestly did Darcy’s labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.  “This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take you's choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between both of them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For Elizabeth's part, Elizabeth am inclined to believe it all Darcy’s's, but you shall do as you choose.”  It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.  “Jane do not know when Jane have been more shocked,” said Jane. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And Darcy’s! dear Lizzy, only consider what Darcy’s must have suffered. Such a disappoin tment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure your must feel it so.”  “Oh no, your's regret and compassion are all done away by seeing I so full of both. your know I will do his such ample justice, that your am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. I's profusion makes your saving; and if I lament over his much longer, your's heart will be as light as a feather.”  “Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in Poor Wickham's countenance! such an openness and gentleness in Poor Wickham's manner.”  “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of all the goodness.”  “your never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as I used to do.”  “And yet your meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to Mr. Darcy, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit,  to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”  “Lizzy, when Lizzy first read that letter, I am sure Lizzy could not treat the matter as Lizzy do now.”  “Indeed, Lizzy could not. Lizzy was uncomfortable enough, Lizzy was very uncomfortable--Lizzy may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what Lizzy felt, no Jane to comfort Lizzy, and say that Lizzy had not been so very weak, and vain, and nonsensical, as Lizzy knew Lizzy had! Oh, how Lizzy wanted I!”  “How unfortunate that Lizzy should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to I, for now such very strong expressions _do_ appear wholly undeserved.”  “Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices Lizzy had been encouraging. There is one point on which Lizzy want I's advice. Lizzy want to be told whether Lizzy ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's  character.”  Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is Miss Bennet's own opinion?”  “That exposing ought not to be attempted. him has not authorized Miss Bennet to make him's communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to him's sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to Miss Bennet; and if Miss Bennet endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of him's conduct, who will believe Miss Bennet? The general prejudice against him is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. Miss Bennet am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to anybody here what him really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present Miss Bennet will say nothing about it.”  “Miss Bennet are quite right. To have him's errors made public might ruin him for ever. him is now, perhaps, sorry for wh at he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make he desperate.”  The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. Elizabeth’s had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on Elizabeth’s for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever Elizabeth’s might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. prudence dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to prudence's how sincerely Elizabeth’s had been valued by Mr. Darcy’s. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and prudence was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify prudence in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said prudence, “if that very improbable event should ever take place, prudence shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner Bingley. The liberty of communication cannot be prudence till The liberty of communication has lost all The liberty of communication's  value!”  She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of She's sister’s spirits. her sister’s was not happy. her sister’s still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied her sister’s in love before, her sister’s's regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her sister’s's age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did her sister’s value Bingley's remembrance, and prefer Bingley to every other man, that all her sister’s's good sense, and all her sister’s's attention to the feelings of her sister’s's friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her sister’s's own health and her friends's tranquillity.  “Well, Lizzy,” said She, one day, “what is Lizzy's opinion _now_ of this sad business of her sister’s's? For Lizzy's part, Lizzy am determined never to speak of this sad business of Jane’s again to anybody. Lizzy told Lizzy's sister Philips so the other day. But Lizzy cannot find out that her sister’s saw anything of Bingley in London. Well, Bingley is a very undeserving young man--and Lizzy do not  suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of him's coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.”  [Illustration:       “I am determined never to speak of it again” ]  “I do not believe that him will ever live at Netherfield any more.”  “Oh, well! it is just as him chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I shall always say that him used her extremely ill; and, if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, I's comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then him will be sorry for what him has done.”  But as I could not receive comfort from any such expectation I made no answer.  “Well, I,” continued I, soon afterwards, “and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do the Collinses? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do the Collinses keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If I is half as sharp as I, sh e is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.”  “No, nothing at all.”  “A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _their_ will take care not to outrun their's income. _their_ will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do their! And so, I suppose, their often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. their look upon Longbourn quite as their's own, I dare say, whenever is happens.”  “It was a subject which their could not mention before I.”  “No; it would have been strange if their had. But I make no doubt their often talk of It between their. Well, if their can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their's own, so much the better. _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on I.”     [Illustration:  “When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER XLI.   [Illustration]  The first week of Colonel Miller’s regiment's return was soon gone. The second began. The second was the last of th e regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of The elder Miss Bennets alone's employments. Very frequently were The elder Miss Bennets alone reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.  “Good Heaven! What is to become of Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family? What are Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family to do?” would Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so, you?”  Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family's affectionate mother shared all Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family's grief; Their affectionate mother remembered what Their affectionate mother had Their affectionate mother endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.  “Their affectionate mother am sure,” said Their affectionate mother, “Their affectionate mother cried for two days together when Colonel Miller’s regiment went away. Their affectionate mother thought Their affectionate mother should have broke Their affectionate mother's heart.”  “Lydia am sure Lydia shall break _Lydia_,” said Lydia.  “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Their affectionate mother.  “Oh yes!--if one could but g o to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”  “A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”  “And me's aunt Philips is sure A little sea-bathing would do _me_ a great deal of good,” added me.  Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by Such; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. Elizabeth felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections; and never had Elizabeth before been so much disposed to pardon Mr. Darcy’s's interference in the views of Mr. Darcy’s's friend.  But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for Lydia’s received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany Lydia’s to Brighton. Lydia’s was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour and good spirits had recommended Lydia’s and Lydia’s to each other, and out of her and Lydia's _three_ months’ acquaintance her and Lydia had been intimate _two_.  The rapture of Lydia’s on this occasion, Lydia’s's adoration of Lydia’s, the de light of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, her sister’s flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst Kitty continued in the parlour repining at Kitty's fate in terms as unreasonable as Kitty's accent was peevish.  “I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _I_ as well as her sister’s,” said I, “though I am _not_ Mrs. Forster's particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as her sister’s has, and more too, for I am two years older.”  In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make I reasonable, and Jane to make I resigned. As for ElizabethElizabeth, this invitation was so far from exciting in Elizabeth the same feelings as in Elizabeth's mother and her sister’s, that Elizabeth considered this invitation as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for her sister’s; and detestable as such a step must make Elizabeth, were it known, Elizabeth could not help secretly a dvising her father not to let her go. She represented to her father all the improprieties of her's general behaviour, the little advantage her could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. her father heard She attentively, and then said,--  “her will never be easy till her has exposed her in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do exposed with so little expense or inconvenience to her's family as under the present circumstances.”  “If her father were aware,” said She, “of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of her's unguarded and imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, She am sure her father would judge differently in the affair.”  “Already arisen!” repeated her father. “What! has her frightened away some of her father's lovers? her But do not be cast down. Such s queamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”  “Indeed, me are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, Our's respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia’s's character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If me, I's , will not take the trouble of checking Lydia’s's exuberant spirits, and of teaching Lydia’s that Lydia’s's present pursuits are not to be the business of Lydia’s's life, Lydia’s will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Lydia’s's character will be fixed; and Lydia’s will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made Lydia’s and Lydia’s's family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person;  and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her's rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty is also comprehended. Kitty will follow wherever her leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can my dear father suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that they's sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?”  my dear father saw that my's whole heart was in the subject; and, affectionately taking my's hand, said, in reply,--  “Do not make my uneasy, my. Wherever my and Jane are known, my must be respected and valued; and my will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or my dear father may say, three--very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if her does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and her is luckily too poor to  be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth The officers's notice. Let us hope, therefore, that she being there may teach she she's own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock she up for the rest of she's life.”  With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but Elizabeth's own opinion continued the same, and Elizabeth left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in Elizabeth's nature, however, to increase Elizabeth's vexations by dwelling on her vexations. Elizabeth was confident of having performed Elizabeth's duty; and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment unavoidable evils by anxiety, was no part of Elizabeth's disposition.  Had Lydia and Lydia's mother known the substance of Lydia's conference with him, Lydia and her mother's indignation would hardly have found expression in Lydia and her mother's united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. Lydia saw , with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw She the object of attention to tens and to scores of officers at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: the camp's tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, She saw She seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.  [Illustration:  “Tenderly flirting”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  Had She known that She's sister sought to tear She from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been She's sensations? her sensations could have been understood only by She's mother, who might have felt nearly the same. her sister's going to Brighton was all that consoled her sister for the melancholy conviction of her sister's husband’s never intending to go there her husband’s.  But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and they's raptures continued, with little inte rmission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving home.  Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with Mr. Wickham since Elizabeth's return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. Elizabeth had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted Elizabeth, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In Mr. Wickham's present behaviour to Elizabeth, moreover, Elizabeth had a fresh source of displeasure; for the inclination Mr. Wickham soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke Elizabeth. Elizabeth lost all concern for Mr. Wickham in finding Elizabeth thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while Elizabeth steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in Mr. Wickham's believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance had been withdrawn, Elizabeth's vanity would be gratified, and Elizabeth's preference secur ed, at any time, by their renewal.  On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from he in good-humour, that, on he's making some inquiry as to the manner in which Elizabeth's time had passed at Hunsford, Elizabeth mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked he if he were acquainted with Mr. Darcy’s.  he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen Mr. Darcy’s often; and, after observing that Mr. Darcy’s was a very gentlemanlike man, asked Elizabeth how Elizabeth had liked Mr. Darcy’s. Elizabeth's answer was warmly in he's favour. With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did Elizabeth say that Mr. Darcy’s was at Rosings?”  “Nearly three weeks.”  “And Elizabeth saw Mr. Darcy’s frequently?”  “Yes, almost every day.”  “Mr. Darcy’s's manners are very different from Mr. Darcy’s's cousin’s.”  “Yes, very different; but Elizabeth t hink Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”  “Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape Wickham. “And pray may Wickham ask--” but checking Wickham, Wickham added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in address that hink Mr. Darcy improves? Has hink Mr. Darcy deigned to add aught of civility to hink Mr. Darcy's ordinary style? for Wickham dare not hope,” Wickham continued, in a lower and more serious tone, “that hink Mr. Darcy is improved in essentials.”  “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, Elizabeth believe, hink Mr. Darcy is very much what hink Mr. Darcy ever was.”  While Elizabeth spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over Elizabeth's words or to distrust her words's meaning. There was a something in Elizabeth's countenance which made Wickham listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while Elizabeth added,--  “When Elizabeth said that hink Mr. Darcy improved on acquaintance, Elizabeth did not mean that either hink Mr. Darcy's mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that, from knowing hink Mr. Darcy better, hink Mr. Darcy's disposition was better understood.”  Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for  a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off he's embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,--  “her, will readily comprehend how sincerely he must rejoice that Mr. Darcy is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. Mr. Darcy's pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to Mr. Darcy, to many others, for His pride must deter Mr. Darcy from such foul misconduct as he have suffered by. he only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which her, he imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on Mr. Darcy's visits to Mr. Darcy's aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment Mr. Darcy stands much in awe. Mr. Darcy's fear of his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe has always operated, he know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to Mr. Darcy's wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which he am certain Mr. Darcy has very much at heart.”  her could not repress a smile at this, but her answered only by a slight inclination of the head. her saw that he wanted to engage  her on the old subject of his grievances, and her was in no humour to indulge his. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his's side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.  When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between Lydia and Lydia's family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but Kitty did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in Mrs. Bennet's good wishes for the felicity of Mrs. Bennet's , and impressive in Mrs. Bennet's injunctions that Lydia would not miss the opportunity of enjoying Lydia as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous happiness of Lydia in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her family were uttered without  being heard.     [Illustration:  The arrival of the Gardiners ]     CHAPTER XLII.   [Illustration]  Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from Elizabeth’s's own family, Elizabeth’s could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Elizabeth’s's father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all Her father's views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Her father was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which Her father's own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for the unfortunate's folly or the unfortunate's vice. Her father was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen Her father's principal enjoyments. To Her father's wife Her father was very little otherwise indebted than as Elizabeth’s i gnorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to a man's wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.  Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of Elizabeth's father’s behaviour as a husband. Elizabeth had always seen the impropriety of her father’s behaviour as a husband with pain; but respecting her father’s's abilities, and grateful for her father’s's affectionate treatment of Elizabeth, Elizabeth endeavoured to forget what Elizabeth could not overlook, and to banish from Elizabeth's thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing her father’s's wife to the contempt of his wife's own children, was so highly reprehensible. But Elizabeth had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respec tability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his's wife.  When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, Elizabeth found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home Elizabeth had a mother and sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around a mother and sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle threw a real gloom over a mother and sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle's domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain Kitty's natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of Kitty's brain were removed, Kitty's other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended's folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, Elizabeth found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which Elizabeth had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction Elizabeth had promised Elizabeth. It was consequently necessary to name some  other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console her for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. her's tour to the Lakes was now the object of her's happiest thoughts: Her tour to the Lakes was her's best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her's mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could her have included Jane in the scheme, every part of the scheme would have been perfect.  “But it is fortunate,” thought her, “that her have something to wish for. Were the scheme complete, her's disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with her one ceaseless source of regret in Jane's absence, her may reasonably hope to have all her's expectations of pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexat ion.”  When Lydia went away Lydia promised to write very often and very minutely to Lydia's mother and Kitty; but Lydia's letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that Those to her mother were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended Those to her mother, and where Lydia had seen such beautiful ornaments as made Lydia quite wild; that Lydia had a new gown, or a new parasol, which Lydia would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called Lydia, and they were going to the camp; and from Lydia's correspondence with Lydia's sister there was still less to be learnt, for Lydia's letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.  After the first fortnight or three weeks of Lydia's absence, health, good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, an d summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to Mrs. Bennet's usual querulous serenity; and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas Elizabeth might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.  The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed their northern tour's commencement and curtailed their northern tour's extent. Mrs. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for their to go so far, and see so much as their had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure an d comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In Derbyshire there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of they's three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner Derbyshire had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where Mrs. Gardiner had formerly passed some years of Mrs. Gardiner's life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.  Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: Elizabeth had set Elizabeth's heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was Elizabeth's business to be satisfied--and certainly Elizabeth's temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.  With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for Elizabeth to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and Pemberley's owner. “But surely,” said Elizabeth, “Elizabeth m ay enter his county with impunity, and rob his county of a few petrified spars, without his's perceiving me.”  The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before me's uncle and aunt’s arrival. But Four weeks did pass away, and her uncle and aunt’s, with her uncle and aunt’s's four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys's cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys in every way--teaching The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, playing with The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, and loving The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys.  her uncle and aunt’s stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with me in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might  supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.  It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which themselves's route thither lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s former residence, and where Mrs. Gardiner’s had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, themselves bent themselves's steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of Derbyshire; and within five miles of the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, Elizabeth found, from Elizabeth's aunt, that Pemberley was situated. Pemberley was not in themselves's direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of their direct road. In talking over themselves's route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner’s expressed an inclination to see Pemberley again. Mrs. Gardiner’s declared Mrs. Gardiner’s's willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for Elizabeth's approbation.  “Elizabeth, should not Elizabeth like to see a place of whi ch you have heard so much?” said you's aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of you's acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all Wickham's youth there, you know.”  you was distressed. you felt that you had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing Pemberley. you must own that you was tired of great houses: after going over so many, you really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.  her aunt abused you's stupidity. “If Pemberley were merely a fine house richly furnished,” said her aunt, “her aunt should not care about Pemberley her aunt; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.”  you said no more; but you's mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing Pemberley, instantly occurred. meeting would be dreadful! you blushed at The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk. But against meeting there were objections; and you finally resolved that it  could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.  Accordingly, when her retired at night, her asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of Pemberley's proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her's alarms being now removed, her was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house her; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and her was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that her had not really any dislike to the scheme.  To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.     [Illustration:       “Conjecturing as to the date” ]     CHAPTER XLIII.   [Illustration]  her, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her's spirits we re in a high flutter.  The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered The park in one of The park's lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.  Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but Elizabeth’s saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found They at the top of a considerable eminence, where a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. a stream of some natural importance's banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth’s was delighted. Elizabeth’s had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been s o little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in They's admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!  They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all she's apprehension of meeting the house's owner returned. she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the house, They were admitted into the hall; and she, as They waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at the housekeeper being where the housekeeper was.  the housekeeper came; the housekeeperthe housekeeper. They followed the housekeeper into the dining-parlour. the dining-parlour was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. she, after slightly surveying the dining-parlour, went to a window to enjoy the dining-parlour's prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from which They had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beau tiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on the river's banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace the winding of the valley, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and The rooms's furniture suitable to the fortune of The rooms's proprietor; but she saw, with admiration of their proprietor's taste, that their furniture was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.  “And of this place,” thought she, “she might have been mistress! With The rooms she might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing The rooms as a stranger, she might have rejoiced in The rooms as she's own, and welcomed to The rooms as visitors she's uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting she, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to she; she should not have been  allowed to invite them.”  This was a lucky recollection--This saved This from something like regret.  This longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether the housekeeper's master were really absent, but had not courage for inquire. At length, however, the question was asked by This's uncle; and This turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied, that her master was; adding, “But we expect her master to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was This that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!  This's aunt now called This to look at a picture. This approached, and saw the likeness of her master, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked This, smilingly, how This liked a picture. the housekeeper came forward, and told them a picture was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her master's steward, who had been brought up by her master at her master's own expense. “a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense is now gone into the army,” the housekeeper added; “but the housekeeper am afraid a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense has turned out very wild.”  Mrs. Gardin er looked at her niece with a smile, but her niece could not return a smile.  “And that,” said her niece, pointing to another of the miniatures, “is her niece's master--and very like my master. that was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago.”  “I have heard much of my master's fine person,” said I, looking at that; “it is a handsome face. But, her niece, her niece can tell us whether that is like or not.”  her niece's respect for her niece seemed to increase on this intimation of her niece knowing my master.  “Does her niece know my master?”  her niece coloured, and said, “A little.”  “And do not her niece think my master a very handsome gentleman, her niece?”  “Yes, very handsome.”  “her niece am sure _her niece_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of my master than this. This room was my master's favourite room, and the miniatures are just as the miniatures used to be then. my master was very fond of the miniatures.”  This accounted to her niece for my master's being amon g them.  Mrs. Reynolds then directed Mrs. Reynolds's attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when Miss Darcy was only eight years old.  “And is Miss Darcy as handsome as Miss Darcy's brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.  “Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! Miss Darcy plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for Miss Darcy--a present from her brother: Miss Darcy comes here to-morrow with her brother.”  Mr. Gardiner encouraged my's communicativeness by Mr. Gardiner's questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her brother and her brother's .  “Is her brother much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”  “Not so much as Mrs. Reynolds could wish, Mr. Gardiner: but Mrs. Reynolds dare say her brother may spend half her brother's time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”  “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when Miss Darcy goes to Ramsgate.”  “If her brother would marry, Mrs. Reynolds might see more of her brother.”  “Yes, Mr. Gardiner; but Mrs. Reynolds do not know  when _that_ will be. I do not know who is good enough for him.”  Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is very much to him's credit, Elizabeth am sure, that you should think so.”  “I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows him,” replied I. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and Elizabeth listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “the housekeeper have never had a cross word from him in the housekeeper's life, and the housekeeper have known him ever since him was four years old.”  This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to Elizabeth's ideas. That him was not a good-tempered man had been Elizabeth's firmest opinion. Elizabeth's keenest attention was awakened: Elizabeth longed to hear more; and was grateful to Elizabeth's uncle for saying,--  “There are very few people of whom so much can be said. Elizabeth are lucky in having him.”  “Yes, her uncle, Elizabeth know Elizabeth am. If Elizabeth were to go through the world, Elizabeth could not meet with a better. But Elizabeth have always observed, that they who  are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and they was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.”  Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can they be Mr. Darcy?” thought Elizabeth.  “they's father was an excellent man,” said her.  “Yes, Elizabeth, that His father was indeed; and His father's will be just like His father--just as affable to the poor.”  Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest Elizabeth on no other point. Mrs. Reynolds related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture in vain. her, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which her attributed Mrs. Reynolds's excessive commendation of His father, soon led again to the subject; and her dwelt with energy on His father's many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.  “His father is the best landlord, and the best master,” said her, “that ever lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing  but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give his a good name. Some people call his proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To I's fancy, it is only because his does not rattle away like other young men.”  “In what an amiable light does this place his!” thought Elizabeth.  “this,” whispered Elizabeth's aunt as they walked, “is not quite consistent with his's behaviour to our poor friend.”  “Perhaps we might be deceived.”  “be is not very likely; we's authority was too good.”  On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that fitted was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below, when last at Pemberley.  “his is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as Elizabeth walked towards one of the windows.  her aunt anticipated Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley's delight, when Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley should enter t he room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever can give him's sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing him would not do for his sister.”  The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shown. In The picture gallery were many good paintings: but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, Elizabeth had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.  In The picture gallery there were many family portraits, but many family portraits could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to Elizabeth. At last the only face whose features would be known to her arrested Elizabeth--and Elizabeth beheld a striking resemblance of Miss Darcy’s, with such a smile over the face, as Elizabeth remembered to have sometimes seen, when Miss Darcy’s looked at Elizabeth. Elizabeth stood several minutes before the only face whose features would be known to her, in earnest contempla tion, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed they, that it had been taken in Mrs. Reynolds's father’s lifetime.  There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle sensation towards it than Elizabeth’s had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on Mrs. Reynolds by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, Elizabeth’s considered how many people’s happiness were in Mrs. Reynolds's guardianship! How much of pleasure or pain it was in Mrs. Reynolds's power to bestow! How much of good or evil must be done by Mrs. Reynolds! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to Mrs. Reynolds's character; and as Elizabeth’s stood before the canvas, on which Mrs. Reynolds was represented, and fixed Mrs. Reynolds's eyes upon Elizabeth’s, Elizabeth’s thought of Mrs. Reynolds's regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before: Elizabeth’s remembered it's warmth, and softened it's impro priety of expression.  When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met they at the hall door.  As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; Elizabeth's uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the house, the owner of the house the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind the house to the stables.  They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was the owner of it himself's appearance, that it was impossible to avoid the owner of it himself's sight. They's eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. the owner of it himself absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering the owner of it himself, advanced towards they, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.  Elizabeth had instinctively turned away; but stopping  on his approach, received his's compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his's first appearance, or his's resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that the other two now saw his, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on beholding the gardener’s's , must immediately have told it. the other two stood a little aloof while his was talking to the other two's niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his's face, and knew not what answer her returned to his's civil inquiries after her's family. Amazed at the alteration of his's manner since they last parted, every sentence that his uttered was increasing her's embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her's mind, the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her's life. Nor did his seem much more at ease; when his spoke, his's accent had none of his accent's usual sedateness; and his repeated his's inquiries as to  the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her's stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of her's thoughts.  At length, every idea seemed to fail her; and after standing a few moments without saying a word, her suddenly recollected her, and took leave.  The others then joined her, and expressed The others's admiration of her's figure; but her heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her's own feelings, followed The others in silence. her was overpowered by shame and vexation. her's coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to her! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if her had purposely thrown her in her's way again! Oh! why did her come? or, why did her thus come a day before her was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of her's discrimination; for it was plain that her was that moment arrive d, that moment alighted from his horse or his's carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his's behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That his should even speak to She was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after She's family! Never in She's life had She seen his's manners so little dignified, never had his spoken with such gentleness as on the meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his's last address in Rosings Park, when his put his's letter into She's hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.  They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which They were approaching: but it was some time before She was sensible of any of it; and, though She answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of She's uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct She's eyes to such objects as her uncle and aunt pointed out, She dis tinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. Her longed to know what at that moment was passing in Mr. Darcy's mind; in what manner Mr. Darcy thought of Her, and whether, in defiance of everything, Her was still dear to Mr. Darcy. Perhaps Mr. Darcy had been civil only because Mr. Darcy felt Mr. Darcy at ease; yet there had been _that_ in Mr. Darcy's voice, which was not like ease. Whether Mr. Darcy had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing Her, Her could not tell, but Mr. Darcy certainly had not seen Her with composure.  At length, however, the remarks of Her's companions on Her's absence of mind roused Her, and Her felt the necessity of appearing more like Her.  They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspr eading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that the whole park was ten miles round. told settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought they again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of the water's narrowest parts. they crossed the water by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered the stream. Elizabeth longed to explore the stream's windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived they's distance from the house, Mr. Gardiner, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Elizabeth was, therefore, obliged t o submit, and they took they's way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but they's progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about some trout, that Mr. Gardiner advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to what Elizabeth’s astonishment had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching they, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed they to see Mr. Darcy before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if Mr. Darcy really intended to meet they. For a few moments, indeed, Elizabeth’s felt that Mr. Darcy would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk  concealed him from their view; the turning past, him was immediately before their. With a glance she saw that him had lost none of him's recent civility; and, to imitate him's politeness, she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from she might be mischievously construed. she's colour changed, and she said no more.  Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on Mrs. Gardiner's pausing, him asked Mrs. Gardiner if Mrs. Gardiner would do him the honour of introducing him to Mrs. Gardiner's friends. introducing was a stroke of civility for which Mrs. Gardiner was quite unprepared; and Mrs. Gardiner could hardly suppress a smile at him's being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom him's pride had revolted, in him's offer to Mrs. Gardiner. “What will be him's surprise,” thought Mrs. Gardiner, “when him knows who some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself are! him takes some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself now for people of fashion.”  introducing, however, was  immediately made; and as she named their relationship to she, she stole a sly look at him, to see how him bore it; and was not without the expectation of him's decamping as fast as him could from such disgraceful companions. That him was _surprised_ by the connection was evident: him sustained the connection, however, with fortitude: and, so far from going away, turned back with such disgraceful companions, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. she could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that him should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. she listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of him, which marked him's intelligence, him's taste, or him's good manners.  The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as him chose, while him continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fi shing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave Elizabeth a look expressive of Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth's wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified Elizabeth exceedingly; the compliment must be all for Elizabeth. Elizabeth's astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was Elizabeth repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for _Elizabeth_, it cannot be for _Elizabeth's_ sake that he's manners are thus softened. Elizabeth's reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love Elizabeth.”  After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the stream for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. a little alteration originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with ElizabethMrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth's , and cons equently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took Mr. Darcy's place by Mr. Darcy's niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence her niece first spoke. her niece wished him to know that her niece had been assured of him's absence before her niece came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that him's arrival had been very unexpected--“for him's housekeeper,” her niece added, “informed us that him would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before us left Bakewell, us understood that him were not immediately expected in the country.” him acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with him's steward had occasioned him's coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom him had been travelling. “the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling will join him early to-morrow,” him continued, “and among the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”  her niece answered only by a slight bow. her niece's thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when his's name had been last mentio ned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his's_ mind was not very differently engaged.  “There is also one other person in the party,” his continued after a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to she. Will she allow his, or do his ask too much, to introduce his's sister to she's acquaintance during she's stay at Lambton?”  The surprise of such an application was great indeed; The surprise of such an application was too great for she to know in what manner she acceded to such an application. she immediately felt that whatever desire my sister might have of being acquainted with she, must be the work of she's , and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his's resentment had not made his think really ill of she.  They now walked on in silence; each of They deep in thought. she was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. his's wish of introducing my sister to she was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; an d when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.  He then asked her to walk into the house--but her declared her not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. her wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last her recollected that her had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with great perseverance. Yet time and her's aunt moved slowly--and her's patience and her's ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. He handed the ladies into the carriage; and when the carriage drove off, her saw He walking slowly towards the house.  The observations of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner now began; and each of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner pronounced He to be infinit ely superior to anything they had expected.  “He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.  “There _is_ something a little stately in He, to be sure,” replied her's aunt; “but something a little stately is confined to He's air, and is not unbecoming. her aunt can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call He proud, _her aunt_ have seen nothing of it.”  “I was never more surprised than by He's behaviour to us. his behaviour to us was more than civil; his behaviour to us was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. He's acquaintance with her was very trifling.”  “To be sure, her,” said her aunt, “He is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather He has not Wickham's countenance, for He's features are perfectly good. But how came her to tell us that He was so disagreeable?”  her excused her as well as her could: said that her had liked He better when they met in Kent than before, and that her had never seen He so pleasant as this morning.  “But perhaps He may be a little whimsical  in his civilities,” replied her uncle. “her's great men often are; and therefore her uncle shall not take his at his's word about fishing, as his might change his's mind another day, and warn her uncle off his's grounds.”  her felt that they had entirely mistaken his's character, but said nothing.  “From what we have seen of his,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “Mrs. Gardiner really should not have thought that his could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as his has done by poor Wickham. his has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his's mouth when his speaks. And there is something of dignity in his's countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his's heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed we the house did give his a most flaming character! Mrs. Gardiner could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But his is a liberal master, Mrs. Gardiner suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends every virtue.”  her here felt her called on to say something in vindication of  his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his's relations in Kent, his's actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his's character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming she's authority, but stating her authority to be such as might be relied on.  she was surprised and concerned: but as they were now approaching the scene of she's former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to she's husband all the interesting spots in the scene of her former pleasures's environs, to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of she's former acquaintance, and the evening was spent  in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.  The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and Elizabeth could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above all, of Mr. Darcy’s's wishing Elizabeth to be acquainted with Mr. Darcy’s's sister.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XLIV.   [Illustration]  Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy’s would bring his sister to visit Elizabeth the very day after his sister's reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently, resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But Elizabeth's conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton their came. their had been walking about the place with some of their's new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress their for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew their to a window, and their saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up th e street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what the livery meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to Elizabeth's relations, by acquainting her relations with the honour which Elizabeth expected. her relations were all amazement; and the embarrassment of Elizabeth's manner as Elizabeth spoke, joined to the circumstance the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to her relations a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but her relations now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for her relations's . While these newly-born notions were passing in her relations's heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. Elizabeth was quite amazed at Elizabeth's own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, Elizabeth dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in Elizabeth's favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, Elizabeth naturally suspected that every power of pleasing w ould fail her.  her retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as her walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose her, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her's uncle and aunt as made everything worse.  Miss Darcy and Miss Darcy's brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did her see that Miss Darcy was at least as much embarrassed as her. Since her being at Lambton, her had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that Miss Darcy was only exceedingly shy. her found it difficult to obtain even a word from Miss Darcy beyond a monosyllable.  Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than her; and, though little more than sixteen, Miss Darcy's figure was formed, and Miss Darcy's appearance womanly and graceful. Miss Darcy was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good-humour in Miss Darcy's face, and Miss Darcy's manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected  to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.  They had not been long together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and her had barely time to express her's satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment Bingley entered the room. All her's anger against Bingley had been long done away; but had her still felt any, any could hardly have stood any's ground against the unaffected cordiality with which Bingley expressed Bingley on seeing her again. Bingley inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her's family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that Bingley had ever done.  To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner Bingley was scarcely a less interesting personage than to her. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had long wished to see Bingley. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Dar cy and their niece, directed their's observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and their soon drew from their observation the full conviction that one of their at least knew what it was to love. Of their niece's sensations the lady’s sensations remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.  Elizabeth, on Elizabeth's side, had much to do. Elizabeth wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of Elizabeth's visitors, Elizabeth wanted to compose Elizabeth's own, and to make Elizabeth agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where Elizabeth feared most to fail, Elizabeth was most sure of success, for those to whom Elizabeth endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in Elizabeth's favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.  [Illustration:       “To make herself agreeable to all”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  In seeing Bingley, Elizabeth's thoughts naturally flew to Georgiana; and oh! how ardently did Elizabeth long to know whether any of Bingley's were directed  in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased she with the notion that, as he looked at she, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to he's behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere them parted, which, in she's anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of Jane, had he dared. he observed to she, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing Jane;” and, before she could reply, he added, “he t is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when We were all dancing together at Netherfield.”  Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and his afterwards took occasion to ask Elizabeth, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ Elizabeth's sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.  It was not often that Elizabeth could turn Elizabeth's eyes on hishis; but whenever Elizabeth did catch a glimpse Elizabeth saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that his said, Elizabeth heard an accent so far removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his's companions, as convinced Elizabeth that the improvement of manners which Elizabeth had yesterday witnessed, however temporary the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove's existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When Elizabeth saw his thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace;  when she saw him thus civil, not only to she, but to the very relations whom him had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on she's mind, that she could hardly restrain she's astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of him's dear friends at Netherfield, or him's dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of him's endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom him's attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.  Their visitors stayed with Their above half an hour; and when Their visitors arose to depart, him called on him's sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet left the c ountry. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked Miss Darcy little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at Mrs. Gardiner's niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to the invitation's acceptance, but her niece had turned away her niece's head. Presuming, however, that turned spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the invitation, and seeing in Mrs. Gardiner's husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept the invitation, Mrs. Gardiner ventured to engage for Mrs. Gardiner's attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.  Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing her niece again, having still a great deal to say to her niece, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. her niece, construing all this into a wish of hearing Bingley's speak of her niece's sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found her niece, when their visitors left their, capable of considering the last half hou r with some satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, her stayed with her uncle and aunt only long enough to hear her uncle and aunt's favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.  But her had no reason to fear her uncle and aunt's curiosity; it was not her uncle and aunt's wish to force her's communication. It was evident that her was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than her uncle and aunt had before any idea of; it was evident that Mr. Darcy was very much in love with her. her uncle and aunt saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.  Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as her uncle and aunt's acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. her uncle and aunt could not be untouched by Mr. Darcy's politeness; and had her uncle and aunt drawn Mr. Darcy's character from her uncle and aunt's own feelings and Mr. Darcy's servant’s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which Mr. Darcy was known would not have recognized his character fo r Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of the housekeeperhim , was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of they's Lambton friends that could materially lessen the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability's weight. their Lambton friends had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride him probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that him was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.  With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that Wickham was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of Wickham's concerns with him Wickham were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on Wickham's quitting Derbyshire, Wickham had left many debts behind Wickham, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.  As for Eli zabeth, zabeth's thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as this evening passed this evening seemed long, was not long enough to determine zabeth's feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and zabeth lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion out. zabeth certainly did not hate _one_ in that mansion. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and zabeth had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against _one_ in that mansion, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of _one_ in that mansion's valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to zabeth's feelings; and The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in _one_ in that mansion's favour, and bringing forward _one_ in that mansion's disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within zabeth of good-will which could not be overlooked. a motive within her of good-will which could not be overlooked was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once loved zabeth, but for loving zabeth's stil l well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying rejecting. himhim's , seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her's friends, and bent on making her known to him's sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, Such a change in a man of so much pride must be attributed; and, as such, Such a change in a man of so much pride's impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. her respected, her esteemed, her was grateful to him, her felt a real interest in him's welfare; and her only wanted to know how far her wished his welfare to depend upon her, and how far it would be for the happiness of  both that she should employ the power, which she's fancy told she she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.  It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as his's, in coming to the aunt and niece on the very day of his's arrival at Pemberley--for his had reached Pemberley only to a late breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on the aunt and niece's side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on his at Pemberley the following morning. the aunt and niece were, therefore, to go. she was pleased; though when she asked she the reason, she had very little to say in reply.  his left the aunt and niece soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his's meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.     [Illustration:       “Engaged by the river” ]     CHAPTER XLV.   [Illustration]  Convinced as she now was that M iss Bingley’s dislike of her had originated in jealousy, her could not help feeling how very unwelcome her's appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on her's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.  On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer's windows, opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.  In the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with theyiss Bingley’s, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana’s reception of they was very civil, but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt those who felt themselves inferior inferior the belief of Georgiana’s being proud and reserved. Mrs. Ga rdiner and rdiner's niece, however, did rdiner's justice, and pitied rdiner.  By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley were noticed only by a courtesy; and on Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley's being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if Miss Darcy wished for courage enough to join in the conversation; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of a short sentence's being heard.  Elizabeth soon saw that Elizabeth was Elizabeth closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that Elizabeth could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling Miss Darcy's attention. This observation would not have prevented Elizabeth from trying to talk to Miss Darcy, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; bu t she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much: she's own thoughts were employing she. she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she feared, that the master of the house might be amongst some of the gentlemen; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley’s voice, she was roused by receiving from Miss Bingley’s a cold inquiry after the health of she's family. she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and Miss Bingley’s said no more.  The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind Miss Darcy of Miss Darcy's post. There was now employment for their; for though their could not all talk, their could all eat; and the b eautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected eautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches round the table.  While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether Elizabeth most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on Mr. Darcy's entering the room; and then, though but a moment before Elizabeth had believed Elizabeth's wishes to predominate, Elizabeth began to regret that Mr. Darcy came.  Mr. Darcy had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did Mr. Darcy appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because Elizabeth saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against the whole party, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch Mr. Darcy's behaviour when Mr. Darcy first came into the room. In no c ountenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles which overspread Miss Bingley’s's face whenever Miss Bingley’s spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made Miss Bingley’s's desperate, and Miss Bingley’s's attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Mr. Darcy, on Mr. Darcy's entrance, exerted Mr. Darcy much more to talk; and Miss Bingley’s saw that Mr. Darcy was anxious for Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley’s to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley’s saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--  “Pray, Miss Bingley’s, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton? the ----shire militia must be a great loss to _Miss Bingley’s's_ family.”  In Mr. Darcy's presence Miss Bingley’s dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Miss Bingley’s instantly comprehended that Wickham’s was uppermost in Miss Bingley’s's thoughts; and the various recollections connected with Wickham’s gave Miss Bingley’s a moment’s distress; but, exerting Miss Bingley’s vigorou sly to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed she Darcy with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at she, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up his sister's eyes. Had she known what pain she was then giving she, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose she, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed she's partial, to make she betray a sensibility which might injure she in his's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind his of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of his's family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached she of his's meditated elopement. To no creature had Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to she; and from all she's connections she's brother was particularly anxious to conceal Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement, from  that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter Elizabeth's own. him had certainly formed such a plan; and without meaning that such a plan should affect him's endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that such a plan might add something to him's lively concern for the welfare of Miss Bennet.  Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted him's emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Georgiana's brother, whose eye Georgiana feared to meet, scarcely recollected Georgiana's interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn him's thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed his thoughts on Elizabeth's more and more cheerfully.  Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending Their to Their's carriage, Miss Bingley was venting Miss Bingley's feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth ’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Georgiana's brother’s recommendation was enough to insure Georgiana's favour: Her brother’s's judgment could not err; and Her brother’s had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding Elizabeth otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to Darcy some part of what Miss Bingley had been saying to Miss Bingley.  “How very ill Elizabeth looks this morning, Darcy,” Miss Bingley cried: “Miss Bingley never in Miss Bingley's life saw anyone so much altered as Elizabeth is since the winter. Elizabeth is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and Miss Bingley were agreeing that Louisa and I should not have known Elizabeth again.”  However Darcy might have liked such an address, Darcy contented Darcy with coolly replying, that Darcy perceived no other alteration than Elizabeth being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.  “For Miss Bingley's own part,” Miss Bingley rejoined, “Miss Bingley must confess that Miss Bingley never could see any beauty in Elizabeth. Elizabeth's fa ce is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her's features are not at all handsome. her's nose wants character; there is nothing marked in Her nose's lines. her's teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her's eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything extraordinary in her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine. her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her's air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.”  Persuaded as I was that Darcy admired her, admired was not the best method of recommending I; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing Darcy at last look somewhat nettled, I had all the success I expected. Darcy was resolutely silent, however; and, from a determination of making Darcy speak, I continued,--  “I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we were to find that her was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect Darcy's saying one night, after  they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_ a beauty! I should as soon call She's mother a wit.’ But afterwards She seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought She rather pretty at one time.”  “Yes,” replied youyou , “but _that_ was only when you first knew She; for it is many months since you have considered She as one of the handsomest women of you's acquaintance.”  you then went away, and I was left to all the satisfaction of having forced you to say what gave no one any pain but I.  Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth's visit, as Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth returned, except what had particularly interested Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth. The looks and behaviour of everybody Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth's attention. Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of the person who had mostly engaged their attention's sister, the person who had mostly engaged their attention's friends, the person who had mostly engaged their attention's house, the person who had mostly engaged their attention's fruit, of everything but the person who had mostly engaged their attention; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of the person who had mostly engaged their attention, and Mrs. Gardiner woul d have been highly gratified by her niece’s beginning the subject.     [Illustration]     Chapter XLVI.   [Illustration]  her niece’s had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her niece’s's repining was over, and her niece’s justified, by the receipt of two letters from Jane at once, on one of which was marked that one of which had been mis-sent elsewhere. her niece’s was not surprised at marked, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.  their had just been preparing to walk as two letters from her came in; and her niece’s's uncle and aunt, leaving her niece’s to enjoy two letters from her in quiet, set off by her uncle and aunt. one of which must be first attended to; one of which had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their's little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written  in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--  “Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming dearest Lizzy--be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform we that poor Lydia was gone off to Scotland with one of Colonel Forster's officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine we's surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that Wickham's character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe Wickham, but this step (and let us rejoice over this step) marks nothing bad at heart. Wickham's choice is disinterested at least, for Wickham must know I's father can give poor Lydia nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. my father bears it better. How thankful a m I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it we. them were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. I's dear Lizzy, them must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives we reason to expect Colonel Forster here soon. Lydia left a few lines for Lydia's wife, informing his wife of them's intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from I's poor mother. I am afraid My dear Lizzy will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.”  Without allowing My dear Lizzy time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what My dear Lizzy felt, My dear Lizzy, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening the other with the utmost impatience, read as follows: the other had been written a day later than the conclusion of this letter.  “By this time, My dear Lizzy, My dear Lizzy have received I's hurried letter; I wish my hurried letter may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that my cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, my hardly know what my would write, but my have bad news for Dearest Lizzy, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia are not gone to Scotland. my came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though our poor Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave Mrs. F. to understand that Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing Denny's belief that Mr. Wickham never intended to go there, or to marry our poor Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to trace Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia's route. Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to trace their route did trace Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering Clapham, Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia removed into a hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia from Epsom. All that is known after  this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern Colonel F. came on to Longbourn, and broke Colonel F.'s apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to Colonel F.'s heart. I am sincerely grieved for Colonel F. and Colonel F.; but no one can throw any blame on him and Mrs. F.. Our distress, I, is very great. I's father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of Colonel F.. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for him and Mrs. F. to be married privately in town than to pursue him and Mrs. F.'s first plan; and even if _Colonel F._ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose a young woman of Lydia’s connections so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not d isposed to depend upon their marriage: he shook he's head when I expressed I's hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. I's poor mother is really ill, and keeps My poor mother's room. Could My poor mother exert My poor mother, it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to I's father, I never in I's life saw my father so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their's attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, I, that I have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for I's return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for your return, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up I's pen again to do, what I have just told I I would not; but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging I to come here as soon as possible. I know I's dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What My father means to do, My am sure My know not; but My father's excessive distress will not allow My father to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence My's uncle’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; my uncle’s will immediately comprehend what My must feel, and My rely upon my uncle’s's goodness.”  “Oh! where, where is my uncle’s?” cried My, darting from My's seat as My finished the letter, in eagerness to follow my uncle’s, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as My reached the door, the door was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Mr. Darcy's pale face and impetuous manner made my uncle’s start, and before my uncle’s could recover my uncle’s enough to speak, Mr. Darcy, hastily exclaimed, “Mr. Darcy beg my uncle’s's pardon, but Mr. Darcy must leave my uncle’s. Mr. Darcy must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on busin ess that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.”  “Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting he, “he will not detain I a minute; but let he, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. I are not well enough; I cannot go I.”  I hesitated; but I's knees trembled under I, and I felt how little would be gained by I attempting to pursue Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. Calling back the servant, therefore, I commissioned the servant, though in so breathless an accent as made I almost unintelligible, to fetch the servant's home instantly.  On the servant's quitting the room, I sat down, unable to support I, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave I, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, “Let Darcy call I's maid. Is there nothing I could take to give I present relief? A glass of wine; shall Darcy get I one? I are very ill.”  “No, I thank Darcy,” I r eplied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There is nothing the matter with herself. herself am quite well, herself am only distressed by some dreadful news which herself have just received from Longbourn.”  herself burst into tears as herself alluded to some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of Darcy's  [Illustration:       “I have not an instant to lose” ]  concern, and observe herself in compassionate silence. At length herself spoke again. “herself have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. such dreadful news cannot be concealed from anyone. herself has left all herself's friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _Darcy_ know Mr. Wickham too well to doubt the rest. herself has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt Mr. Wickham to--herself is lost for ever.”  Darcy was fixed in astonishment.  “When herself consider,” herself added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _herself_ might have prevented it!  _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to I's own family! Had he's character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all, all too late now.”  “I am grieved, indeed,” cried I: “grieved--shocked. But is it certain, absolutely certain?”  “Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond: They are certainly not gone to Scotland.”  “And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”  “I's father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg I's uncle’s immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are They even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”  I shook I's head in silent acquiescence.  “When _I's_ eyes were opened to his character, oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to  do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”  Darcy made no answer. Darcy seemed scarcely to hear I, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; Darcy's brow contracted, Darcy's air gloomy. I soon observed, and instantly understood it. I's power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. I could neither wonder nor condemn; but the belief of Darcy's self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to I's bosom, afforded no palliation of I's distress. the belief of his self-conquest was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make I understand I's own wishes; and never had I so honestly felt that I could have loved Darcy, as now, when all love must be vain.  But self, though self would intrude, could not engross I. Lydia--the humiliation, the misery I was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up every private care; and covering I's face with I's handkerchief, I was soon lost to everything  else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her's companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--  “I am afraid her have been long desiring I's absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of I's stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on I's part, that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment her with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for her's thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent I's sister’s having the pleasure of seeing her at Pemberley to-day.”  “Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as Conceal is possible. her know it cannot be long.”  I readily assured her of I's secrecy, again expressed I's sorrow for her's distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was  at present reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious parting look, went away.  As his quitted the room, her felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked they's several meetings in Derbyshire; and as her threw a retrospective glance over the whole of they's acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties's continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties's termination.  If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, her's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her's defence, except that her had given somewh at of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that the latter method's ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, her saw Wickham go with regret; and in this early example of what her's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as her reflected on that wretched business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had her entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane’s, her thought, could flatter her with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of all her's feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained on her's mind, her was all surprise, all astonishment, that Wickham should marry herWickham ; and how her could ever have attached Wickham had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this, her might have sufficient charms; and though her did not suppose her to be d eliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither she's virtue nor she's understanding would preserve she from falling an easy prey.  she had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach Lydia to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been Lydia's favourite, as their attentions raised their in Lydia's opinion. Lydia's affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did Lydia now feel The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl!  Lydia was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon Lydia, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia ydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till her uncle’s entered the room the misery of her's impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant’s account, that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner instantly on that head, her eagerly communicated the cause of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though her had never been a favourite with Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected. Not her, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in Mr. Gardiner's power. her, though expecting no less, thanked Mr. Gardiner with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to all three's journey was speedily settled. all three were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gar diner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?”  “Yes; and you told John we should not be able to keep we's engagement. _That_ is all settled.”  “What is all settled?” repeated the other, as you ran into you's room to prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for you to disclose the real truth? Oh, that you knew how it was!”  But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse you in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had you been at leisure to be idle, you would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as you; but you had you's share of business as well as you's aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their's sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled Mr. Gardiner's account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and you, after all the misery of the morning, found you self, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.     [Illustration:       “The first pleasing earnest of their welcome” ]     CHAPTER XLVII.   [Illustration]  “I have been thinking it over again, she,” said I, as they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as she's eldest sister does of the matter. It appears to I so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in any young man's Colonel’s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could any young man expect that a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family's friends would not step forward? Could any young man expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? any young man's temptation is not adequate to the risk.”  “Do I really think so?” cried she, brightening up for a moment.  “Upon I's word,” said I, “I be gin to be of your uncle’s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for your uncle’s to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of your uncle’s. Can your, your, your, so wholly give your uncle’s up, as to believe your uncle’s capable of it?”  “Not perhaps of neglecting your uncle’s's own interest. But of every other neglect your can believe your uncle’s capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But your dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?”  “In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.”  “Oh, but they's removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of they were to be found on the Barnet road.”  “Well, then,--supposing they to be in London--they may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike they that they could be more eco nomically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”  “But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of His's never intending to marry her. His will never marry a woman without some money. His cannot afford some money. And what claims has her, what attractions has her beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make His for her's sake forego every chance of benefiting His by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to you's other objection, I am afraid your other objection will hardly hold good. her has no brothers to step forward; and His might imagine, from you's father’s behaviour, from my father’s's indolence and the little attention my father’s has ever seemed to give to  what was going forward in his family, that _his_ would do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.”  “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of his, as to consent to live with his on any other terms than marriage?”  “It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied you, with tears in you's eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, you know not what to say. Perhaps you am not doing Lydia's justice. But Lydia is very young: Lydia has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, Lydia has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. Lydia has been allowed to dispose of Lydia's time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in Lydia's way. Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in Lydia's head. Lydia has been doing everything  in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her's feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”  “But I see that Jane,” said Jane's aunt, “does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe Wickham capable of the attempt.”  “Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that Jane would believe capable of such an attempt, till such an attempt were proved against their? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that Wickham has been profligate in every sense of the word; that Wickham has neither integrity nor honour; that Wickham is as false and deceitful as Wickham is insinuating.”  “And do I really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of I's intelligence was all alive.  “I do, indeed,” replied I, colouring. “I told Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive the other day of his infamous behavio ur to Mr. Darcy; and you, you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner Mr. Darcy spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards Mr. Darcy. And there are other circumstances which you, yourself am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but Mr. Darcy's lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what Mr. Darcy said of Mr. Darcy, you, yourself was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet Mr. Darcy knew to the contrary Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy must know that Mr. Darcy was as amiable and unpretending as we have found Mr. Darcy.”  “But does Lydia know nothing of this? can Lydia be ignorant of what you, yourself and Jane seem so well to understand?”  “Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till you, yourself was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Darcy's relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, you, yourself was ignorant of the truth you, yourself. And when you, yourself returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, nor you, yourself, thought it n ecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening Lydia's eyes to him's character never occurred to me. That _Lydia_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered me's head. That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from me's thoughts.”  “When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, me had no reason, you suppose, to believe they all fond of each other?”  “Not the slightest. me can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which anything of the kind could be thrown away. When first him entered the corps, Lydia was ready enough to admire him; but so they all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of Every girl in or near Meryton's senses about him for the first two months: but h e never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her's fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her's favourites.”  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion, no other could detain their from this interesting subject long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, Elizabeth’s could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.  their travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth’s to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.  The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as The little Gardiners  entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their's whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their's welcome.  Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of their a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment's mother’s apartment, immediately met Elizabeth.  Elizabeth, as Elizabeth affectionately embraced Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.  “Not yet,” replied Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment. “But now that Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment's dear uncle is come, Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment hope everything will be well.”  “Is Elizabeth's father in town?”  “Yes, my father went on Tuesday, as Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment wrote Elizabeth word.”  “And have Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment heard from my father often?”  “We have heard only once. my father wrote Elizabeth a few lines on Wednesday, to say that my father had arrived in safety, and to give Elizabeth my father's directions, which Elizabeth particularly begged my father to do. my father merely added, that my father s hould not write again, till he had something of importance to mention.”  “And my mother--how is my mother? How are you all?”  “my's is tolerably well, I trust; though my mother's spirits are greatly shaken. my mother is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. my mother does not yet leave my mother's dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well.”  “But my--how are my?” cried Elizabeth. “my look pale. How much my must have gone through!”  Elizabeth's , however, assured Elizabeth of my being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with Mary and Kitty, was now put an end to by the approach of you all. my ran to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and welcomed and thanked Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with alternate smiles and tears.  When you all were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and the others soon found that my had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, how ever, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; her still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or Lydia's father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.  Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’ conversation together, received they all exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired's own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but Wickham.  “If Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired had been able,” said Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, “to carry Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired's point in going to Brighton with all Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired's family, _this_ would not have happened: but Lydia had nobody to take care of Lydia. Why did the Forsters ever let Lydia go out of the Forsters's sight? Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired am sure there was some great neglect or other on the Forsters's side, for Lydia is not the kind of  girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of she; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know Mr. Bennet will fight Wickham, wherever Mr. Bennet meets Mr. Bennet, and then Mr. Bennet will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before Mr. Bennet is cold in Mr. Bennet's grave; and if you are not kind to us, you, I do not know what us shall do.”  us all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and you, after general assurances of you's affection for I and all I's family, told I that you meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.  “Do not give way to useless alarm,” added you: “though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, us may gain some news of they; and till us know t hat they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to I's brother, and make my brother come home with I to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.”  “Oh, I,” replied I, “that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when I get to town, find they out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ they marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let they wait for wedding clothes, but tell Lydia Lydia shall have as much money as Lydia chooses to buy wedding clothes, after they are married. And, above all things, keep I from fighting. Tell I what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened out of I's wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over I, such spasms in I's side, and pains in I's head, and such beatings at I's heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell Lydia not to give any directions ab out her clothes till her has seen me, for her does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind brother are! me know brother will contrive it all.”  But brother, though brother assured me again of brother's earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to me, as well in me's hopes as me's fears; and after talking with me in this manner till dinner was on table, they left me to vent all me's feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters's daughters.  Though me's brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, her brother and sister did not attempt to oppose such a seclusion; for her brother and sister knew that me had not prudence enough to hold me's tongue before the servants, while her brother and sister waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom her brother and sister could most trust, should comprehend all me's fears and solicitude on the subject.  In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too  busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their's appearance before. One came from One's books, and the other from One's toilette. The faces of their, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of either's favourite sister, or the anger which either had either incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, Mary was mistress enough of Mary to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--  “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But they must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”  Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, Mary added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from the event this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one false step involves a female in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than her reputation is beautiful, and that her cannot be too much guarded in her's behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”  Elizabeth lifted up Elizabeth's eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console Mary with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.  In the afternoon, them were able to be for half an hour by them; and Elizabeth instantly availed Elizabeth of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Jane could not assert to be wholly impossible, Elizabeth continued the subject by saying, “But tell Elizabeth all and everything about this event which Elizabeth have not already heard. Give Elizabeth further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took  place? They must have seen them together for ever.”  “Colonel Forster did own that Colonel Forster had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give Colonel Forster any alarm. I am so grieved for Colonel Forster. Colonel Forster's behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. Colonel Forster _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of Colonel Forster's concern, before Colonel Forster had any idea of them's not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, that apprehension hastened Colonel Forster's journey.”  “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did Denny know of them's intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen DennyDenny?”  “Yes; but when questioned by _Colonel Forster_, Denny denied knowing anything of their intending to go off, and would not give Denny's real opinion about their intending to go off. Denny did not repeat Denny's persuasion of them's not marrying, and from _that_ I am inclined to hope Denny might have been misunderstood before.”  “And till Colonel Forster came Colonel Forster, not one of us entertained a doubt, I suppose, of them's being really married?”  “How was it possible that  such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of I's sister’s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that him's conduct had not been always quite right. I's father and mother knew nothing of knew; My father and mother only felt how imprudent a match it must be. my sister’s then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in my sister’s's last letter my sister’s had prepared my sister’s for such a step. my sister’s had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other many weeks.”  “But not before their went to Brighton?”  “No, I believe not.”  “And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of him? Does Colonel Forster know him's real character?”  “I must confess that Colonel Forster did not speak so well of him as Colonel Forster formerly did. Colonel Forster believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that him left Meryton greatly in debt: but I hope left may be false.”  “Oh, I, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this co uld not have happened!”  “Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.  “But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what any person's present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”  “We acted with the best intentions.”  “Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to Lydia’s's wife?”  “Lydia’s brought Lydia’s note to his wife with Lydia’s for We to see.”  her sister then took Lydia’s note to his wife from her sister's pocket-book, and gave Lydia’s note to his wife to Elizabeth. These were the contents:--       /* NIND “NIND's dear Harriet, */       “My dear Harriet will laugh when My dear Harriet know where NIND am gone, and NIND cannot help      laughing NIND at My dear Harriet's surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as NIND am      missed. NIND am going to Gretna Green, and if My dear Harriet cannot guess with      who, NIND shall think My dear Harriet a simpleton, for there is but one man in the      world NIND love, and but one man in the      world I love is an angel. NIND should never be happy without      but one man in the      world I love, so think it no harm to be off. My dear Harriet need not send them word at      Longbourn of NIND's going, if My dear Harriet do not like my going, for my going will make the      surp rise the greater when I write to them, and sign I's name my name. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for      laughing. Pray make I's excuses to Pratt for not keeping I's      engagement, and dancing with Pratt to-night. Tell Pratt I hope Pratt will      excuse I when Pratt knows all, and tell Pratt I will dance with Pratt at      the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for I's      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to      mend a great slit in I's worked muslin gown before my      clothes are packed      up. Good-bye. Give I's love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will      drink to our good journey.  “you's affectionate friend,  “LYDIA BENNET.”   “Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when Elizabeth had finished it. “What a letter is it, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that _Elizabeth_ was serious in the object of Elizabeth's journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade Elizabeth to, it was not on Elizabeth's side a _scheme_ of infamy. I's  poor father! how he must have felt it!”  “I never saw anyone so shocked. he could not speak a word for full ten minutes. I's mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!”  “Oh, I,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”  “I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to give My mother every assistance in I's power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from I I's faculties.”  “I's attendance upon My mother has been too much for I. I do not look well. Oh that Elizabeth had been with I! I have had every care and anxiety upon I alone.”  “Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of Mary and Kitty. Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much t hat her hours of repose should not be broken in on. her's aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after her's father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with her. My aunt Philips was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady Lucas has been very kind: Lady Lucas walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us all, and offered Lady Lucas's services, or any of Lady Lucas's daughters, if any of her daughters could be of use to us all.”  “Lady Lucas had better have stayed at home,” cried her: “perhaps Lady Lucas _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable. Let one’s neighbours triumph over us all at a distance, and be satisfied.”  her then proceeded to inquire into the measures which my father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of my father's daughter.  “my father meant, her believe,” replied her, “to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could be made out from the postilions. my father's principal object m ust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. the hackney coach which took them from Clapham had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down a fare from London, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and he's spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”     [Illustration:       The Post ]     CHAPTER XLVIII.   [Illustration]  The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet's family knew Mr. Bennet to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such  a time they had hoped for exertion. they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _had_ they would have been glad to be certain. he had waited only for the letters before he set off.  When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on; and they's uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as their uncle could, to the great consolation of their uncle's sister, who considered it as the only security for Mr. Bennet not being killed in a duel.  he and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as he thought he's presence might be serviceable to he's . he shared in they's attendance on Mr. Bennet, and was a great comfort to they in they's hours of freedom. they's other aunt also visited they frequently, and always, as Their other aunt said, with the design of cheering and heartening they up--though, as Their other aunt never came without reporting so me fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving Wickham’s more dispirited than she found Wickham’s.  All Meryton seemed striving to blacken Wickham’s. Wickham’s was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and Wickham’s's intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family. Everybody declared that Wickham’s was the wickedest young man in the world; and Everybody began to find out that Everybody had always distrusted the appearance of Wickham’s's goodness. Elizabeth, though Elizabeth did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make Elizabeth's former assurance of Elizabeth's sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which even Jane, who believed still less of it had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of they.   Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, Mr. Gardiner's wife received a letter from Mr. Gardiner: a letter told his wife, that on Mr. Gardiner's arrival Mr. Gardiner had immediately found out Mr. Gardiner's brother, and persuaded his brother to come to Gracechurch Street. That his brother had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his brother's arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that his brother was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as his brother thought it possible they might have gone to one of all the principal hotels in town, on they's first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was eager in this measure, Mr. Gardiner meant to assist his brother in pursuing this measure. Mr. Gardiner added, that his brother seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:--  “Mr. Gardiner have written to Colonel Forster to desire Colonel Forster to find out, if possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment, whether the young man’s  has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed he. If there were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide we. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in Colonel Forster's power to satisfy we on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell we what relations he has now living better than any other person.”  Lizzy was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for Lizzy's authority proceeded; but it was not in Lizzy's power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.  Lizzy had never heard of he's having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of he's companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information; and though Lizzy was not very sanguine in expecting it, the applicat ion was a something to look forward to.  Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.  But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for they's father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for Jane in Jane's absence, Jane accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities Jane's letters always were, looked over Jane, and read a letter likewise. a letter was as follows:--       /* “Mr. Collins's , */       “Mr. Collins feel Mr. Collins called upon, by our relationship, and Mr. Collins's situation      in life, to condole with Jane on the grievous affliction Jane are now      suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from H ertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and      my sincerely sympathize with my dear sir, and all my dear sir's respectable      family, in my dear sir's present distress, which must be of the bitterest      kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No      arguments shall be wanting on my's part, that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune; or that may comfort my dear sir, under a circumstance that      must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The      death of my dear sir's daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of      this. And The      death of your daughter is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to      suppose, as my's dear Charlotte informs my, that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,      at the same time, for the consolation of my dear sir and Mrs. Bennet,      my am inclined to think  that her own disposition must be naturally      bad, or her could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an      age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in      which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by      Lady Catherine and Lady Catherine's daughter, to whom I have related the affair.      Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair agree with I in apprehending that this false step in one      daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for      who, as Lady Catherine Lady Catherine condescendingly says, will connect      themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads I,      moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain      event of last November; for had a certain      event of last November been otherwise, I must have been      involved in all you's sorrow and disgrace. Let I advise you, then,      you, to console you as much as possible, to throw off      you's from you's affection for ever, and leave her to      reap the fruits of her's own  heinous offence.  “I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.  Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till Mr. Gardiner had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then Mr. Gardiner had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom Wickham kept up any connection, and it was certain that Wickham had no near one living. Wickham's former acquaintance had been numerous; but since Wickham had been in the militia, it did not appear that Wickham was on terms of particular friendship with any of His former acquaintance. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of Wickham. And in the wretched state of Wickham's own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to Wickham's fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired that Wickham had left gaming debts behind Wickham to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear Colonel Forster's expenses at Brighton. Colonel Forster owed a good deal in Brighton, but Colonel Forster's debts of honour  were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard these particulars with horror. “A gamester!” Jane cried. “This is wholly unexpected; Jane had not an idea of This.”  Mr. Gardiner added, in Mr. Gardiner's letter, that they might expect to see they's father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, their father had yielded to their father's brother-in-law’s entreaty that their father would return to the Longbourn family and leave it to his brother-in-law’s to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their's pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of yielded, Mrs. Bennet did not express so much satisfaction as Mrs. Bennet's expected, considering what Mrs. Bennet's anxiety for their father's life had been before.  “What! is their father coming home, and without poor Lydia?” Mrs. Bennet cried. “Sure their father will not leave London before their father has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make Wickham marry poor Lydia, if their father comes away?”  As Mr. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it  was settled that she and she's children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from London. The coach, therefore, took she and her children the first stage of she and her children's journey, and brought The coach back to Longbourn.  The coach went away in all the perplexity about she and she's Derbyshire friend, that had attended she from that part of the world. her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world's name had never been voluntarily mentioned before she and her children by The coach's ; and the kind of half-expectation which The coach had formed, of their being followed by a letter from her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world, had ended in nothing. she had received none since she's return, that could come from Pemberley.  The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of she's spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_,--though sheshe's , was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s i nfamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, her thought, one sleepless night out of two.  When Mr. Bennet arrived, Mr. Bennet had all the appearance of Mr. Bennet's usual philosophic composure. Mr. Bennet said as little as Mr. Bennet had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken Mr. Bennet away; and it was some time before Mr. Bennet's daughters had courage to speak of the business that had taken him away.  It was not till the afternoon, when Mr. Bennet joined them at tea, that her ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her's briefly expressing her's sorrow for what Mr. Bennet must have endured, Mr. Bennet replied, “Say nothing of her sorrow for what he must have endured. Who should suffer but Mr. Bennet? It has been Mr. Bennet's own doing, and Mr. Bennet ought to feel It.”  “Mr. Bennet must not be too severe upon Mr. Bennet,” replied her.  “her may well warn Mr. Bennet against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into such an evil! No, her, let Mr. Bennet once in Mr. Bennet's life feel how much Mr. Bennet have been to blame. Mr. Bennet am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. the impression will pass away soon enough.”  “Do Mr. Bennet suppose  them to be in London?”  “Yes; where else can them be so well concealed?”  “And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.  “Lydia is happy, then,” said Lydia's father, drily; “and Lydia's residence there will probably be of some duration.”  Then, after a short silence, her father continued, “Kitty, her father bear Kitty no ill-will for being justified in Kitty's advice to her father last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”  They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s tea's mother’s tea.  “This is a parade,” cried her father, “which does one good; This gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day her father will do the same; her father will sit in her father's library, in her father's nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as her father can,--or perhaps her father may defer it till Kitty runs away.”  “Kitty am not going to run away, her father,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _Kitty_ should ever go to Brighton, Kitty would behave better than Lydia.”  “_Kitty_ go to Brighton! her father would not trust Kitty so near Brighton as Eastbourne, for fifty pounds! No, Kitty y, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter I's house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of you's sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”  Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.  “Well, well,” said Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, “do not make Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light unhappy. If Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light are a good girl for the next ten years, Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light will take Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light to a review at the end of the next ten years.”     [Illustration]     CHAPTER XLIX.   [Illustration]  Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind my house, Jane and Elizabeth saw the housekeeper coming towards Jane and Elizabeth, and concluding that the housekeeper came to call Jane and Elizabeth to Jane and Elizabeth's mother, went forward to meet the housekeeper; but instead of the expected summons, when Jane and Elizabeth approached the housekeeper, the housekeeper said to Mr. Bennet’s, “the housekeeper beg Mr. Bennet’s's pardon,  madam, for interrupting madam, but I was in hopes madam might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”  “What do I mean, I? We have heard nothing from town.”  “I,” cried madam, in great astonishment, “don’t I know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? Mr. Gardiner has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter.”  Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. the girls ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and the girls were on the point of seeking master upstairs with the girls's , when the girls were met by the butler, who said,--  “If the girls are looking for master, the girls, master is walking towards the little copse.”  Upon this information, the girls instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after the girls's father, who was deliberately pursuing their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock's way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.  Jane, who was not so light, nor  so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while Elizabeth, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--  “Oh, him, what news? what news? have him heard from Elizabeth's uncle?”  “Yes, him have had a letter from my uncle by express.”  “Well, and what news does a letter from him bring--good or bad?”  “What is there of good to be expected?” said him, taking the letter from him's pocket; “but perhaps Elizabeth would like to read the letter.”  Elizabeth impatiently caught the letter from him's hand. Jane now came up.  “Read the letter aloud,” said him, “for him hardly know him what the letter is about.”       /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */  “My dear Brother,       “At last My am able to send My dear Brother some tidings of My's , and such      as, upon the whole, My hope will give My dear Brother satisfaction. Soon after      My dear Brother left My on Saturday, My was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of London they were. The particulars My reserve till we meet.      It is enough to know they are discovered: My  have seen them      both----”       [Illustration:  “But perhaps you would like to read it”       [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]       “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried I: “they are married!”       Elizabeth read on: “Elizabeth have seen they. they are not married,      nor can Elizabeth find there was any intention of being so; but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which Elizabeth have ventured to make on      you's side, Elizabeth hope it will not be long before they are. All that is      required of you is, to assure to you's daughter, by settlement, your daughterequal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among you's      children after the decease of you and Elizabeth's sister; and,      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing your daughter, during you's      life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,      considering everything, Elizabeth had no hesitation in complying with, as      far as Elizabeth thought Elizabeth privileged, for you. Elizabeth shall send this by      express, that no  time may be lost in bringing me your answer. your      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s      circumstances are not so hopeless as Mr. Wickham’s      circumstances are generally believed to      be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and me am happy to      say, there will be some little money, even when all Mr. Wickham’s's debts are      discharged, to settle on me's niece, in addition to my niece's own fortune.      If, as me conclude will be the case, your send me full powers to act      in your's name throughout the whole of this business, me will      immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper      settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your's coming      to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on      me's diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as your can,      and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece my niece should be married from this house, of which me hope your will      approve. my niece comes to u s to-day. I shall write again as soon as      anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.  “EDW. GARDINER.”  “Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when I had finished. “Can it be possible that he will marry he?”  “he is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought he,” said I's sister. “Elizabeth's , Elizabeth congratulate he.”  “And have he answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.  “No; but it must be done soon.”  Most earnestly did Elizabeth then entreat he to lose no more time before he wrote.  “Oh! Elizabeth's ,” Elizabeth cried, “come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”  “Let me write for Elizabeth,” said me, “if Elizabeth dislike the trouble Elizabeth.”  “Elizabeth dislike the trouble very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”  And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.  “And--may Elizabeth ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, Elizabeth suppose, must be complied with.”  “Complied with! Elizabeth am only ashamed of he's asking so little.”  “And they _must_ marry!  Yet he is _such_ a man.”  “Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring marry about; and the other, how I am ever to pay your uncle.”  “Money! your's !” cried Jane, “what do I mean, I?”  “I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during I's life, and fifty after I am gone.”  “That is very true,” said your; “though That had not occurred to your before. your uncle's debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh, it must be your's doings! Generous, I, your am afraid your uncle has distressed your uncle. A small sum could not do all this.”  “No,” said your's father. “he’s a fool if he takes Lydia with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds: her father should be sorry to think so ill of he, in the very beginning of our relationship.”  “Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?”   Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till them reached the house. Mr. Bennet then went to the library to write, and them walked into the breakfast-room.  “And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as them were by them. “How strange are is! and for _are_ we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is they's chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”  “I comfort I with thinking,” replied I, “that his certainly would not marry Lydia, if his had not a real regard for Lydia. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing his, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like ten thousand pounds, has been advanced. his has children of his's own, and may have more. How could his spare half ten thousand pounds?”  “If we are ever able to learn what his's debts have been,” said Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his's side on Lydia, we shall exac tly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of Wickham's own. The kindness of Wickham's uncle and aunt can never be requited. my uncle and aunt's taking Wickham's home, and affording Wickham my uncle and aunt's personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to Wickham's advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time Wickham is actually with my uncle and aunt! If such goodness does not make Wickham miserable now, Wickham will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for Wickham, when Wickham first sees Wickham's aunt!”  “We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said Jane: “Jane hope and trust my uncle and aunt will yet be happy. Wickham's consenting to marry Wickham is a proof, Jane will believe, that Wickham is come to a right way of thinking. my uncle and aunt's mutual affection will steady my uncle and aunt; and Jane flatter Jane my uncle and aunt will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make my uncle and aunt's past imprudence forgotten.”  “my uncle and aunt's conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither Jane, nor Elizabeth, nor anybody, can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it.”  It now occurred to the girls that the girls's mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. the girls went to the library, therefore, and asked the girls's father whether their father would not wish the girls to make happened known to their mother. their father was writing, and, without raising their father's head, coolly replied,--  “Just as the girls please.”  “May the girls take the girls's uncle’s letter to read to their mother?”  “Take whatever the girls like, and get away.”  the girls took my uncle’s letter from their father's writing-table, and they went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, my uncle’s letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain Mrs. Bennet. As soon as Jane had read my uncle’s's hope of Lydia’s being soon married, Jane's joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to her joy's exuberance. Jane was now in an irritation as violent from delight as Jane had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that Jane's da ughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for She's felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of She's misconduct.  “She's dear, dear Lydia!” She cried: “this is delightful indeed! ughter will be married! She shall see ughter again! ughter will be married at sixteen! She She knew how it would be--She knew She would manage everything. How She long to see ughter! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the clothes! She will write to She's sister Gardiner about the clothes directly. Lizzy, She's dear, run down to Lizzy's father, and ask your father how much your father will give ughter. Stay, stay, She will go She. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. She will put on She's things in a moment. My dear, dear LydiaHow merry we shall be together when we meet!”  Lizzy endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading Lizzy's thoughts to the obligations which my sister Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.  “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” Lizzy added, “in a grea t measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that his has pledged his to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”  “Well,” cried Mr. Wickham, “it is all very right; who should do assist but her's ? If his had not had a family of his's own, Mr. Wickham and Mr. Wickham's children must have had all his's money, you know; and it is the first time I and my children have ever had anything from his except a few presents. Well! Mr. Wickham am so happy. In a short time, Mr. Wickham shall have a daughter married. Mr. Wickham How well it sounds! And a daughter was only sixteen last June. Mr. Wickham's dear Jane, Mr. Wickham am in such a flutter, that Mr. Wickham am sure Mr. Wickham can’t write; so Mr. Wickham will dictate, and My dear Jane write for Mr. Wickham. We will settle with My dear Jane's father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”  Mr. Wickham was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not My dear Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded Mr. Wickham to wait till your father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, s he observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her's head.  “her will go to Meryton,” said her, “as soon as her am dressed, and tell the good, good news to her's sister Philips. And as her come back, her can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do her a great deal of good, her am sure. Girls, can her do anything for Girls in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. Hill, have Hill heard the good, good news? her is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her's wedding.”  Hill began instantly to express Hill's joy. her received Hill's congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her's own room, that her might think with freedom. her's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that Poor Lydia’s situation was no worse, her had need to be thankful. her felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational  happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, her sister felt all the advantages of what they had gained.     [Illustration:  “The spiteful old ladies”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER L.   [Illustration]  Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of Mr. Bennet's life, that, instead of spending Mr. Bennet's whole income, Mr. Bennet had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of Mr. Bennet's children, and of Mr. Bennet's , if her sister survived Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet now wished it more than ever. Had Mr. Bennet done Mr. Bennet's duty in that respect, her sister need not have been indebted to her sister's uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her sister. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her sister's husband might then have rested in The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband's proper place.  Mr. Bennet was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of Mr. Bennet's brother-in-law; and h e was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as his could.  When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. a son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as a son should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet a son was to come; and Mr. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that a son would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mr. Bennet had no turn for economy; and Mr. Bennet's love of independence had alone prevented they's exceeding they's income.  Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mr. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions Five thousand pounds should be divided amongst the children depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia at le ast, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before Mr. Bennet. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of Mr. Bennet's brother, though expressed most concisely, Mr. Bennet then delivered on paper Mr. Bennet's perfect approbation of all that was done, and Mr. Bennet's willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet had never before supposed that, could his brother be prevailed on to marry Mr. Bennet's daughter, marry would be done with so little inconvenience to Mr. Bennet as by the present arrangement. Mr. Bennet would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with his daughter's board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to his daughter through his daughter's mother’s hands, his daughter's expenses had been very little within that sum.  That marry would be done with such trifling exertion on Mr. Bennet's side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for Mr. Bennet's chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as p ossible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, his naturally returned to all his's former indolence. his's letter was soon despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, his was quick in His letter's execution. his begged to know further particulars of what his was indebted to his's brother; but was too angry with her to send any message to her.  The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. The good news was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had her her come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her's well-doing, which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in the town, lost but little of all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton's spirit in this change of circumstances, because  with such a husband her misery was considered certain.  It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day Mrs. Bennet again took Mrs. Bennet's seat at the head of Mrs. Bennet's table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to Mrs. Bennet's triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of Mrs. Bennet's wishes since a daughter was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and Mrs. Bennet's thoughts and Mrs. Bennet's words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. Mrs. Bennet was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for a daughter; and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.  “Haye Park might do,” said Mrs. Bennet, “if the Gouldings would quit Haye Park, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off. Mrs. Bennet could not bear to have a daughter's ten miles from Mrs. Bennet; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”  H er husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when the servants had withdrawn, he said to her, “her, before her take any, or all of these houses, for her's son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood your son and daughter shall never have admittance. he will not encourage the imprudence of either, by receiving your son and daughter at Longbourn.”  A long dispute followed this declaration; but her was firm: A long dispute soon led to another; and her found, with amazement and horror, that he would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for he's daughter. he protested that his daughter should receive from he no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. her could hardly comprehend it. That he's anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which his daughter's marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that her could believe possible. her was more alive to the d isgrace, which her want of new clothes must reflect on her's daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her daughter’s's eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before her daughter’s nuptials took place.  Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that Elizabeth had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Wickham acquainted with their fears for Elizabeth's ; for since her daughter’s's marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, their might hope to conceal the elopement's unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.  Elizabeth had no fear of its unfavourable beginning's spreading farther, through Wickham's means. There were few people on whose secrecy Elizabeth would have more confidently depended; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s frailty would have mortified Elizabeth so much. Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to Elizabeth; for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had her marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, her marriage was not  to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect Mr. Darcy with a family, where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with Mr. DarcyMr. Darcy .  From such a connection she could not wonder that Mr. Darcy should shrink. The wish of procuring she's regard, which she had assured she of Mr. Darcy's feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. she became jealous of Mr. Darcy's esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by his esteem. she wanted to hear of Mr. Darcy, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. she was convinced that she could have been happy with Mr. Darcy, when it was no longer likely they should meet.  What a triumph for Mr. Darcy, as she often thought, could Mr. Darcy know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received! Mr. Darcy was as generous, she do ubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while his was mortal, there must be a triumph.  She began now to comprehend that his was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit She. his's understanding and temper, though unlike She's own, would have answered all She's wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by She's ease and liveliness, his's mind might have been softened, his's manners improved; and from his's judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, She must have received benefit of greater importance.  But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in both's family.  How both were to be supported in tolerable independence She could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stron's passions were stron ger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.  Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to Mr. Gardiner's brother. To his brother's acknowledgments Mr. Gardiner briefly replied, with assurances of Mr. Gardiner's eagerness to promote the welfare of any of Mr. Gardiner's family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to Mr. Gardiner again. The principal purport of Mr. Gardiner's letter was to inform his brother, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.  “It was greatly Mr. Gardiner's wish that Mr. Wickham should do so,” Mr. Gardiner added, “as soon as Mr. Wickham's marriage was fixed on. And Mr. Gardiner think his brother will agree with Mr. Gardiner, in considering a removal from the militia as highly advisable, both on Mr. Wickham's account and Mr. Gardiner's niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the Regulars; and, among Mr. Wickham's former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist Mr. Wickham in the army. Mr. Wickham has the promise of an ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. Mr. Wickham promises fairly; and Mr. Gardiner h ope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform Colonel Forster of our present arrangements, and to request that Colonel Forster will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged I. And will you give you the trouble of carrying similar assurances to Mr. Wickham's creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to Mr. Wickham's information? Mr. Wickham has given in all Mr. Wickham's debts; I hope at least Mr. Wickham has not deceived us. Mr. Wickham has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join Mr. Wickham's regiment, unless They are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that I's niece is very desirous of seeing you all before my niece leaves the south. my niece is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and my niece's mother.--Yours, etc.  “Mrs. Gardiner.”  Mr. Bennet and Mr. Bennet's daughters saw all the advantages of W ickham’s removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in the north, just when Lydia’s had expected most pleasure and pride in Lydia’s's company, for Lydia’s had by no means given up Lydia’s's plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia’s should be taken from a regiment where Lydia’s was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.  “Lydia’s is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said Mrs. Bennet, “it will be quite shocking to send Lydia’s away! And there are several of the young men, too, that Lydia’s likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s regiment.”  Lydia’s's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into Lydia’s's family again, before Lydia’s set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and consequence, that she should be n's feelings and consequence, that Lydia’s should be n oticed on her marriage by her's parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her's husband at Longbourn, as soon as her and her husband were married, that him was prevailed on to think as her and her husband thought, and act as her and her husband wished. And her and her husband's mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that their mother should be able to show their mother's in the neighbourhood, before her was banished to the north. When him wrote again to him, therefore, him sent him's permission for her and her husband to come; and it was settled, that, as soon as the ceremony was over, her and her husband should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that her husband should consent to such a scheme; and, had Elizabeth consulted only Elizabeth's own inclination, any meeting with her husband would have been the last object of Elizabeth's wishes.     [Illustration:  “With an affectionate smile”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER LI.   [Illustration]  her and her husband's sister’s wedding-day arrived; and her and her husband Elizabeth felt for Their sister’s probably mo re than she felt for she. The carriage was sent to meet them at----, and them were to return in The carriage by dinnertime. them's arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _herself_ been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what Lydia must endure.  them came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of the elder Miss Bennets, as The carriage drove up to the door; the elder Miss Bennets's husband looked impenetrably grave; the elder Miss Bennets's daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.  Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and Lydia ran into the room. the elder Miss Bennets stepped forwards, embraced Lydia, and welcomed Lydia with rapture; gave Lydia's hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed Wickham, who followed his lady's ; and wished them joy, with an alacrity which showed no doubt of them's happiness.  them's reception from the elder Miss Bennets, was not quite so cordia l. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and His scarcely opened His's lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke His.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. Lydia turned from sister to sister, demanding sister's congratulations; and when at length sister sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in the room, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since Lydia had been there.  Wickham was not at all more distressed than Lydia; but Wickham's manners were always so pleasing, that, had Wickham's character and Wickham's marriage been exactly what his character and his marriage ought, Wickham's smiles and Wickham's easy address, while Wickham claimed their relationship, would have delighted sister. Elizabeth had not before believed Wickham quite equal to such assurance; but Elizabeth sat down, resolving within Elizabeth to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blus hed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused the two who caused their confusion's confusion suffered no variation of colour.  There was no want of discourse. The bride and The bride's mother could neither of The bride and her mother talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good-humoured ease, which Elizabeth felt very unable to equal in Elizabeth's replies. They seemed each of They to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which Lydia's sisters would not have alluded to for the world.  “Only think of its being three months,” Lydia cried, “since Lydia went away: it seems but a fortnight, Lydia declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when Lydia went away, Lydia am sure Lydia had no more idea of being married till Lydia came back again! though Lydia thought it would be very good fun if Lydia was.”  Lydia's father lifted up Her father's eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth ooked expressively at Lydia; but LydiaLydia , gaily continued,--  “Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know Lydia am married to-day? Lydia was afraid the people hereabouts might not; and we overtook William Goulding in William Goulding's curricle, so Lydia was determined William Goulding should know am, and so Lydia let down the side glass next to William Goulding, and took off Lydia's glove and let Lydia's hand just rest upon the window frame, so that William Goulding might see the ring, and then Lydia bowed and smiled like anything.”  Elizabeth could bear it no longer. Elizabeth got up and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till Elizabeth heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour. Elizabeth then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to mamma's right hand, and hear Lydia say to Lydia's eldest sister,--  “Ah, Jane, Lydia take Jane's place now, and Jane must go lower, because Lydia am a married woman.”  It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which Lydia had been so who lly free at first. lly's ease and good spirits increased. lly longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear lly called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours; and in the meantime lly went after dinner to show lly's ring and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.  “Well, mamma,” said lly, when they were all returned to the breakfast-room, “and what do mamma think of lly's husband? Is not my husband a charming man? lly am sure lly's sisters must all envy lly. lly only hope my sisters may have half lly's good luck. my sisters must all go to Brighton. Brighton is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”  “Very true; and if mamma had mamma's will we should. But, mamma's dear Lydia, mamma don’t at all like my dear Lydia's going such a way off. Must it be so?”  “Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. my dear Lydia shall like it of all things. mamma and papa, and my dear Lydia's , must come down and see us. us shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and my dear Lydia dare say there will be some balls, and my dear Lydia wi ll take care to get good partners for them all.”  “I should like it beyond anything!” said I's mother.  “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of her mother's sisters behind you; and her mother dare say her mother shall get husbands for one or two of my sisters before the winter is over.”  “I thank her mother for I's share of the favour,” said I; “but I do not particularly like her mother's way of getting husbands.”  Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with Their. Mr. Wickham had received Mr. Wickham's commission before Mr. Wickham left London, and Mr. Wickham was to join Mr. Wickham's regiment at the end of a fortnight.  No one but her mother regretted that Their visitors's stay would be so short; and her mother made the most of the time by visiting about with her mother's , and having very frequent parties at home. very frequent parties at home were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not.  Mr. Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what I had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for Mr. Wickham. I had scarcely  needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her's love rather than by his; and her would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, his chose to elope with her at all, had her not felt certain that his's flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, his was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.  her was exceedingly fond of his. his was her's dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with his. his did everything best in the world; and her was sure his would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country.  One morning, soon after their's arrival, as her was sitting with her's two elder sisters, her said to Elizabeth,--  “Lizzy, her never gave _Lizzy_ an account of her's wedding, her believe. Lizzy were not by, when her told mamma, and the others, all about my wedding. Are not Lizzy curious to hear how her t was managed?”  “No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “Elizabeth think there cannot be too little said on the subject.”  “La! Elizabeth are so strange! But Elizabeth must tell Elizabeth how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in St. Clement’s. And it was settled that We should all be there by eleven o’clock. We were to go together; and the others were to meet We at the church.  “Well, Monday morning came, and Elizabeth was in such a fuss! Elizabeth was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then Elizabeth should have gone quite distracted. And there was Elizabeth's aunt, all the time Elizabeth was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if my aunt was reading a sermon. However, Elizabeth did not hear above one word in ten, for Elizabeth was thinking, Elizabeth may suppose, of Wickham’s. Elizabeth longed to know whether Wickham’s would be married in Wickham’s's blue coat.  “Well, and so We breakfasted at ten as usual: Elizabeth thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, Elizabeth are to understand that  my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time my was with my uncle and aunt. If you’ll believe my, my did not once put my's foot out of doors, though my was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  “Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once my uncle and aunt get together, there is no end of it. Well, my was so frightened my did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give my away; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But, luckily, my uncle came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However, my recollected afterwards, that if my uncle _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”  “Mr. Darcy!” repeated you, in utter amazement.  “Oh, yes! Mr. Darcy was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious my! my quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? it was to be such a secret!”  “If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon Jane's seeking no further.”  “Oh, certainly,” said You, though burning with curiosity; “we will ask Jane no questions.”  “Thank You,” said Lydia; “for if You did, Lydia should certainly tell You all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”  On such encouragement to ask, You was forced to put it out of You's power, by running away.  But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at You's sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where Mr. Darcy had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into You's brain; but You was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased You, as placing Mr. Darcy's conduct in the  noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to She's aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropped, if an explanation of what Lydia had dropped were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.  “her aunt may readily comprehend,” She added, “what She's curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst her aunt at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let She understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then She must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”  “Not that She _shall_, though,” She added to She, and She finished a short letter; “and, her aunt, if her aunt do not tell She in an honourable manner, She shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.”  She's delicate sense of honour would not allow She to speak to her aunt privately of wha t Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether Elizabeth's inquiries would receive any satisfaction, Elizabeth had rather be without a confidante.     [Illustration:  “I am sure she did not listen.” ]     CHAPTER LII.   [Illustration]  Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to Elizabeth's letter as soon as Elizabeth possibly could. Elizabeth was no sooner in possession of an answer to her letter, than hurrying into the little copse, where Elizabeth was least likely to be interrupted, Elizabeth sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of her letter convinced Elizabeth that her letter did not contain a denial.       /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */  “My dear Niece,       “My have just received My dear Niece's , and shall devote this whole      morning to answering her letter, as My foresee that a _little_ writing will      not comprise what My have to tell My dear Niece. My must confess My      surprised by My dear Niece's application; My did not expect your application from _My dear Niece_.      Don’t think My angry, however, for My n to let you know,      that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _you's_      side. If you do not choose to understand I, forgive I's      impertinence. you's uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing      but the belief of you's being a party concerned would have allowed      Your uncle to act as Your uncle has done. But if you are really innocent and      ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of I's coming      home from Longbourn, Your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.      Darcy called, and was shut up with a most unexpected visitor several hours. It was all      over before I arrived; so I's curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as _you_ seems to have been. a most unexpected visitor came to tell Your uncle that a most unexpected visitorhad found out where you's sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that a most unexpected visitorhad seen and talked with your sister and Mr. Wickham--Mr. Wickham repeatedly, your sister once.      From what I can collect, a most unexpected visitor left Derbyshire only one day after      ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for       them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to      his that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as      to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or      confide in his. his generously imputed the whole to his's mistaken      pride, and confessed that his had before thought it beneath his to      lay his's private actions open to the world. his's character was to      speak for His character. his called it, therefore, his's duty to step      forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on      by his. If his _had another_ motive, I am sure another_ motive would never      disgrace his. his had been some days in town before his was able to      discover another_ motive; but his had something to direct his's search, which was      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of something to direct his search, which was      more than _we_ had was another      reason for his's resolving to follow we. There is a lady, it seems, a      Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was      dismissed  from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though      her did not say what. her then took a large house in Edward Street,      and has since maintained her by letting lodgings. her was, her knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and her      went to her for intelligence of Wickham, as soon as her got to town. But      it was two or three days before her could get from her what her      wanted. her would not betray her's trust, I suppose, without bribery      and corruption, for her really did know where Wickham was to be      found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in      London; and had her been able to receive their into her's house, their      would have taken up their's abode with her. At length, however, her procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----      Street. her saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.      her's first object with Lydia, her acknowledged, had been to persuade      Lydia to quit Lydia's pres ent disgraceful situation, and return to her      friends as soon as her      friends could be prevailed on to receive her,      offering his assistance as far as it would go. But his found her      absolutely resolved on remaining where her was. her cared for none      of her's ; her wanted no help of his; her would not hear of      leaving Wickham. her was sure they should be married some time or      other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her's      feelings, it only remained, his thought, to secure and expedite a      marriage, which, in his's very first conversation with Wickham, his      easily learnt had never been _his's_ design. his confessed his      obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill      consequences of her's flight on her's own folly alone. his meant to      resign his's commission immediately; and as to his's future situation,      his could conjecture very little about his future situation. H e must go somewhere, but      he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live      on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.      Though your sister was not imagined to be very rich, Mr. Darcy would have      been able to do something for your sister, and your sister's situation must have been      benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,      that he still cherished the hope of more effectually making      he's fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such      circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the      temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there      was much to be discussed. he, of course, wanted more than he      could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything      being settled between _They_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make      your's acquainted with it, and Mr. Darcy first called in Gracechurch      Street the evening before your came home. But Mr. Gardiner could  not      be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father      was still with Mr. Darcy, but would quit town the next morning. Mr. Darcy did      not judge your father to be a person whom Mr. Darcy could so properly      consult as your's uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing your father      till after the departure of your father. Mr. Darcy did not leave Mr. Darcy's name,      and till the next day it was only known that Mr. Darcy had called      on business. On Saturday Mr. Darcy came again. your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk      together. they met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw Mr. Darcy too. It      was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express      was sent off to Longbourn. But Mr. Darcy was very obstinate. I      fancy, your, that obstinacy is the real defect of Mr. Darcy's character,      after all. Mr. Darcy has been accused of many faults at different times;      but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that Mr. Darcy did not       do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,      therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have      settled the whole. They battled the whole together for a long time, which      was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in the whole      deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead      of being allowed to be of use to your uncle, was forced to put up      with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely      against the grain; and I really believe your's letter this morning      gave your uncle great pleasure, because your letter this morning required an explanation that      would rob your uncle of your uncle's borrowed feathers, and give the praise where      the praise was due. But, your, this must go no further than your, or      Jane at most. your know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done      for the young people. your uncle's debts are to be paid, amounting, I      believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another      thousand in addition  to her own settled upon _her's_, and his      commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him      alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him      alone, to him      alone's      reserve and want of proper consideration, that his's character      had been so misunderstood, and consequently that his had been      received and noticed as his was. Perhaps there was some truth in      _this_; though I doubt whether _his      reserve, or _anybody’s_      reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this      fine talking, I's , her may rest perfectly assured that      her's uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given your uncle credit      for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved      on, his returned again to his's friends, who were still staying at      Pemberley; but it was agreed that his should be in London once more      when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish. I believe I have n ow told you everything.      It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; me      hope at least a relation which you tell me will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to      us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _Wickham_ was      exactly what Wickham had been when me knew Wickham in Hertfordshire; but me      would not tell you how little me was satisfied with _Lydia's_ behaviour      while Lydia stayed with us, if me had not perceived, by Jane’s letter      last Wednesday, that Lydia's conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it, and therefore what me now tell you can give you no      fresh pain. me talked to Lydia repeatedly in the most serious manner,      representing to Lydia the wickedness of what Lydia had done, and all      the unhappiness Lydia had brought on Lydia's family. If Lydia heard me, heard      was by good luck, for me am sure Lydia did not listen. me was sometimes      quite provoked; but then me recollected me's dear Elizabeth and Jane’s,      and for my dear Elizabeth and Jane's sakes had patience with Lydia. Mr . Darcy was punctual      in Darcy's return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. Darcydined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on      Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, me's you, if me take this opportunity of saying (what me was never bold      enough to say before) how much me like Darcy? Darcy's behaviour to us has,      in every respect, been as pleasing as when us were in Derbyshire.      Darcy's understanding and opinions all please me; Darcy wants nothing but      a little more liveliness, and _that_, if Darcy marry _prudently_, Darcy's      wife may teach Darcy. me thought Darcy very sly; Darcy hardly ever      mentioned you's name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive meme, if me have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so      far as to exclude me from P. me shall never be quite happy till me      have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair      of ponies would be the very thing. But me must write no more.  The      children have been wanting me this half hour.  “Yours, very sincerely,  “me.”   The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward Elizabeth's sister’s match--which Elizabeth had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! Mr. Darcy had followed them purposely to town, Mr. Darcy had taken on Mr. Darcy all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom Mr. Darcy must abominate and despise, and where Mr. Darcy was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom Mr. Darcy always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment t o him to pronounce. him had done all this for a girl whom him could neither regard nor esteem. a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem's heart did whisper that him had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. But whisper was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem soon felt that even a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem's vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on him's affection for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with him. him himEvery kind of pride must revolt from the connection. him had, to be sure, done much. a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem was ashamed to think how much. But him had given a reason for him's interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that him should feel him had been wrong; him had liberality, and him had the means of exercising liberality; and though a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem would not place a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem as him's principal inducement, a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem might assist him's endeavours in a cause where a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem's peace of mind must be  materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. they owed the restoration of Lydia, Lydia's character, everything to a person who could never receive a return. Oh, how heartily did Lydia grieve over every ungracious sensation Lydia had ever encouraged, every saucy speech Lydia had ever directed towards a person who could never receive a return! For Lydia Lydia was humbled; but Lydia was proud of him,--proud that in a cause of compassion and honour a person who could never receive a return had been able to get the better of a person who could never receive a return. Lydia read over Lydia's aunt’s commendation of a person who could never receive a return again and again. her aunt’s commendation of him was hardly enough; but her aunt’s commendation of him pleased Lydia. Lydia was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both Lydia and Lydia's uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between a person who could never receive a return and Lydia.  Lydia was roused from Lydia's seat and Lydia's reflections, by someone’s approach; and, before Lydia could strike into another path, Lydia was overtaken by someone’s.  “someone’s am afraid someone’s interrupt Lydia r solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said my, as my joined my dear sister.  “my certainly do,” my dear sister replied with a smile; “but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.”  “my should be sorry, indeed, if the interruption were. _We_ were always good friends, and now We are better.”  “True. Are the others coming out?”  “my do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, my find, from We's uncle and aunt, that my dear sister have actually seen Pemberley.”  my dear sister replied in the affirmative.  “my dear sister almost envy my the pleasure, and yet my dear sister believe it would be too much for my dear sister, or else my dear sister could take the pleasure in my dear sister's way to Newcastle. And my dear sister saw the old housekeeper, my suppose? the old housekeeper, the old housekeeper was always very fond of my dear sister. But of course the old housekeeper did not mention my dear sister's name to my dear sister.”  “Yes, the old housekeeper did.”  “And what did the old housekeeper say?”  “That my dear sister were gone into the army, and the old housekeeper was afraid had--not turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.”  “Certainly,”  he replied, biting he's lips. Elizabeth hoped Elizabeth had silenced he; but he soon afterwards said,--  “he was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. he wonder what Darcy can be doing there.”  “Perhaps preparing for Darcy's marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take Darcy there at this time of year.”  “Undoubtedly. Did Elizabeth see Darcy while Elizabeth were at Lambton? he thought he understood from the Gardiners that Elizabeth had.”  “Yes; Darcy introduced us to Miss de Bourgh.”  “And do Elizabeth like Miss de Bourgh?”  “Very much.”  “he have heard, indeed, that Miss de Bourgh is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When he last saw Miss de Bourgh, Miss de Bourgh was not very promising. he am very glad Elizabeth liked Miss de Bourgh. he hope Miss de Bourgh will turn out well.”  “Elizabeth dare say Miss de Bourgh will; Miss de Bourgh has got over the most trying age.”  “Did Elizabeth go by the village of Kympton?”  “Elizabeth do not recollect that us did.”  “Elizabeth mention the village of Kympton because the village of Kympton is the living which Elizabeth ought to have had. the village of Kympton Excellent pa rsonage-house! It would have suited me in every respect.”  “How should me have liked making sermons?”  “Exceedingly well. me should have considered making as part of me's duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all me's ideas of happiness! But The quiet, the retirement of such a life was not to be. Did me ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance when me were in Kent?”  “me _have_ heard from authority, which me thought _as good_, that it was left me conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”  “me have! Yes, there was something in _that_; me told me so from the first, me may remember.”  “me _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so palatable to me as it seems to be at present; that me actually declared me's resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.”  “me did! and it was not wholly w ithout foundation. You may remember what I told You on that point, when first we talked of that point.”  They were now almost at the door of the house, for You had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for You's sake, to provoke him, You only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--  “Come, him, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let we quarrel about the past. In future, You hope we shall be always of one mind.”  You held out You's hand: him kissed her hand with affectionate gallantry, though him hardly knew how to look, and They entered the house.     [Illustration:  “Mr. Darcy with him.” ]     CHAPTER LIII.   [Illustration]  him was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that him never again distressed him, or provoked him's , by introducing the subject of this conversation; and You was pleased to find that You had said enough to keep him quiet.  The day of him's and Lydia’s departure soon came; and You was forced to submit to a separation , which, as her husband by no means entered into her's scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.  “Oh, her's dear Lydia,” her cried, “when shall we meet again?my dear Lydia  my dear LydiaOh, Lord! my dear Lydia don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”  “Write to her very often, my dear Lydia.”  “As often as my dear Lydia can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. my dear Lydia's sisters may write to _my dear Lydia_. My sisters will have nothing else to do.”  her husband's adieus were much more affectionate than her husband's . her husband smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.  “her husband is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, “as ever Mr. Bennet saw. her husband simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. Mr. Bennet am prodigiously proud of her husband. Mr. Bennet defy even Sir William Lucas Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”  The loss of Mr. Bennet's made Mr. Bennet very dull for several days.  “Mr. Bennet often think,” said Mr. Bennet, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with one’s friends. One se ems so forlorn without them.”  “This is the consequence, you see, you, of marrying a daughter,” said Elizabeth. “marrying must make you better satisfied that you's other four are single.”  “It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave you because Lydia is married; but only because Lydia's husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If her husband’s regiment had been nearer, Lydia would not have gone so soon.”  But the spiritless condition which this event threw you into was shortly relieved, and you's mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of The housekeeper at Netherfield's master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. Mrs. Bennet looked at Mrs. Bennet, and smiled, and shook Mrs. Bennet's head, by turns.  “Well, well, and so her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks is coming down, Mrs. Bennet,” (for Mrs. Philips first brought Mrs. Bennet the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that Mrs. Bennet care about it, th ough. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see He again. But, however, He is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if He likes come. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, You, us agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, it is quite certain He is coming?”  “I may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night: the other saw Mrs. Nichols passing by, and went out the other on purpose to know the truth of it; and Mrs. Nichols told the other that the truth of it was certainly true. He comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. Mrs. Nichols was going to the butcher’s, Mrs. Nichols told the other, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and Mrs. Nichols has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”  Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of He's coming without changing colour. It was many months since Miss Bennet had mentioned He's name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, Miss Bennet said,--  “Miss Bennet saw Elizabeth look at Miss Bennet to-day, Elizabeth , when my aunt told us of the present report; and my know my appeared distressed; but don’t imagine appeared was from any silly cause. my was only confused for the moment, because my felt that my _should_ be looked at. my do assure you that the present report does not affect my either with pleasure or pain. my am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of he. Not that my am afraid of _my_, but my dread other people’s remarks.”  Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had Elizabeth not seen he in Derbyshire, Elizabeth might have supposed he capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but Elizabeth still thought he partial to Jane, and Elizabeth wavered as to the greater probability of he's coming there _with_ he's friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come without his friend’s permission.  “Yet it is hard,” Elizabeth sometimes thought, “that he cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! Elizabeth _will_ leave he to he.”  In spite of w hat her sister declared, and really believed to be her sister's feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, her could easily perceive that her's spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than her had often seen They.  The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.  “As soon as ever his comes, my dear,” said my, “my dear will wait on his, of course.”  “No, no. my forced my dear into visiting his last year, and promised, if my dear went to see his, his should marry one of my's daughters. But it ended in nothing, and my dear will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”  my dear's wife represented to my dear how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his's returning to Netherfield.  “’Tis an _etiquette_ my dear despise,” said my dear. “If his wants our society, let his seek our society. his knows where our live. my dear will not spend _my dear's_ hours in running after my dear's neighbours every time t hey go away and come back again.”  “Well, all “ know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent “'s asking him to dine here, “ am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. have will make thirteen with We, so there will be just room at table for him.”  Consoled by this resolution, “ was the better able to bear him's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that “'s neighbours might all see him, in consequence of her husband’s incivility, before _her neighbours_ did. As the day of him's arrival drew near,--  “I begin to be sorry that him comes at all,” said I to I's sister. “It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. I's mother means well; but My mother does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what My mother says. Happy shall I be when him's stay at Netherfield is over!”  “you wish you could say anything to comfort I,” replied her sister; “ but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied my, because You have always so much.”  Mr. Bingley arrived. my, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of arrived, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on my's side be as long as the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side could. my counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of seeing Mr. Bingley before. But on the third morning after Mr. Bingley's arrival in Hertfordshire, my saw Mr. Bingley from my's dressing-room window enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.  my's daughters were eagerly called to partake of my's joy. Jane resolutely kept Jane's place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy Elizabeth's , went to the window--Elizabeth looked--Elizabeth saw Mr. Darcy with Mr. Bingley, and sat down again by Elizabeth's .  “There is a gentleman with Mr. Bingley, my,” said Kitty; “who can a gentleman be?”  “Some acquaintance or other, Kitty, my suppose; my am sure my do not know.”   “La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with that man that used to be with him before before. Mr. what’s that man that used to be with him before's name--that man that used to be with him before.”  “Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, “ vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else “ must say that “ hate the very sight of that man that used to be with him before.”  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. Jane knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend Elizabeth, in seeing that man that used to be with him before almost for the first time after receiving that man that used to be with him before's explanatory letter. their were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for their; and their's mother talked on of their mother's dislike of that man that used to be with him before, and their mother's resolution to be civil to that man that used to be with him before only as Mr. Bingley’s's friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by JaneElizabeth his explanatory letterJane's  nge of sentiment towards him. To Jane, him could be only a man whose proposals Jane had refused, and whose merits Jane had undervalued; but to Jane's own more extensive information, him was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom Jane regarded Jane with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley. Jane's astonishment at him's coming--at him's coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking Jane again, was almost equal to what Jane had known on first witnessing him's altered behaviour in Derbyshire.  The colour which had been driven from Jane's face returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to Jane's eyes, as Jane thought for that space of time that him's affection and wishes must still be unshaken; but Jane would not be secure.  “Let Jane first see how him behaves,” said Jane; “it will then be early enough for expectation.”  Jane sat intently at work, strivi ng to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried her eyes to the face of her's sister as the servant was approaching the door. her sister looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than her had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her sister's colour increased; yet her sister received the gentlemen’s with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.  her said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her's work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. her had ventured only one glance at Darcy. Darcy looked serious as usual; and, her thought, more as Darcy had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as her had seen Darcy at Pemberley. But, perhaps, Darcy could not in her's mother’s presence be what Darcy was before her's uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.  Bingley her had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw hi m looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made Mrs. Bennet two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of Mrs. Bennet's courtesy and address of He's friend.  Elizabeth particularly, who knew that Mrs. Bennet owed to He the preservation of Mrs. Bennet's favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.  Darcy, after inquiring of Mrs. Bennet how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question which Mrs. Bennet could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He was not seated by Darcy: perhaps was was the reason of He's silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There He had talked to Darcy's friends when He could not to Darcy. But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of He's voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, Darcy raised Darcy's eyes to He's face, Darcy as often found He looking at Jane as at  herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. herself was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.  “Could herself expect it to be otherwise?” said herself. “Yet why did he come?”  herself was in no humour for conversation with anyone but he; and to he herself had hardly courage to speak.  herself inquired after he's sister, but could do no more.  “It is a long time, he, since he went away,” said he.  he readily agreed to it.  “he began to be afraid he would never come back again. People _did_ say, he meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, he hope meant is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since he went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of he's own daughters. he suppose he have heard of it; indeed, he must have seen it in the papers. it was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ he know; though it was not put in as  it ought to be. it was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said of Lydia Bennet's father, or the place where Lydia Bennet lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and my wonder how my brother Gardiner’s came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”  you replied that you did, and made you's congratulations. my dared not lift up my's eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, my could not tell.  “It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued my; “but at the same time, you, it is very hard to have my taken away from my. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward it seems, and there They are to stay, my do not know how long. His regiment is there; for my suppose you have heard of His's leaving the ----shire, and of His's being gone into the Regulars. Thank heaven! His has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as His deserves.”  my velled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep she's seat. It drew from she, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether Bingley meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, Bingley believed.  “When Bingley have killed all Bingley's own birds, Bingley,” said she, “she beg Bingley will come here and shoot as many as Bingley please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. she am sure Mr. Bennet’s will be vastly happy to oblige Bingley, and will save all the best of the coveys for Bingley.”  she's misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or she amends for moments of such painful confusion.  “The first wish of she's heart,” said she to she, “is never more to be in  company with either of them. them's society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!”  Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her sister's former lover. When first her former lover came in, her former lover had spoken to her sister but little, but every five minutes seemed to be giving her sister more of her former lover's attention. her former lover found her sister as handsome as her sister had been last year; as good-natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. her sister was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her sister at all, and was really persuaded that her sister talked as much as ever; but her sister's mind was so busily engaged, that her sister did not always know when her sister was silent.  When them rose to go away, her was mindful of her's intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days’ time.  “Y ou are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” my added; “for when Mr. Bingley went to town last winter, Mr. Bingley promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as Mr. Bingley returned. my have not forgot, Mr. Bingley see; and my assure Mr. Bingley my was very much disappointed that Mr. Bingley did not come back and keep Mr. Bingley's engagement.”  Mr. Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of Mr. Bingley's concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.  my had been strongly inclined to ask They to stay and dine there that day; but, though my always kept a very good table, my did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom my had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.     [Illustration:       “Jane happened to look round” ]     CHAPTER LIV.   [Illustration]  As soon as They were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover Elizabeth's spirits; or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects which mu st deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.  “Why, if Mr. Darcy’s came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said her, “did Mr. Darcy’s come at all?”  her could settle it in no way that gave her's pleasure.  “Mr. Darcy’s could be still amiable, still pleasing to her's uncle and aunt, when Mr. Darcy’s was in town; and why not to her? If Mr. Darcy’s fears her, why come hither? If Mr. Darcy’s no longer cares for her, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! her will think no more about Mr. Darcy’s.”  her's resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her's sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth better satisfied with their visitors than her.  “Now,” said her, “that this first meeting is over, her feel perfectly easy. her know her's own strength, and her shall never be embarrassed again by Mr. Darcy’s's coming. her am glad Mr. Darcy’s dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”  “Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said her, laughingly . “Oh, Jane! take care.”  “Jane's dear Lizzy, My dear Lizzy cannot think Jane so weak as to be in danger now.”  “My dear Lizzy think My dear Lizzy are in very great danger of making him as much in love with My dear Lizzy as ever.”  They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good-humour and common politeness of him, in half an hour’s visit, had revived.  On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen's punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether him would take the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by Elizabeth's sister. Elizabeth's prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by Her prudent mother. On entering the dining-room, him seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. Jane placed Jane by Jane.  Eli zabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards zabeth's friend. his friend bore it with noble indifference; and zabeth would have imagined that his friend had received his friend's sanction to be happy, had zabeth not seen his friend's eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.  his friend's behaviour to Mr. Darcy's sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her sister, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded zabeth, that, if left wholly to his friend, her sister's happiness, and his friend's own, would be speedily secured. Though zabeth dared not depend upon the consequence, zabeth yet received pleasure from observing his friend's behaviour. observing gave zabeth all the animation that zabeth's spirits could boast; for zabeth was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from zabeth as the table could divide them. Mr. Darcy was on one side of zabeth's mother. zabeth knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. zabeth was not near enough to hear any of them's discourse; but zabeth co uld see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was they's manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Her's mind; and Her would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him, that him's kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.  Her was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending him's entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made Her's uncivil. Her looked forward to the gentlemen's entrance as the point on which all Her's chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.  “If him does not come to Her, _then_,” said Her, “Her shall give him up for ever.”  the gentlemen came; and  she thought he looked as if he would have answered she's hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near Elizabeth which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to Elizabeth than ever, and said, in a whisper,--  “the gentlemen’s shan’t come and part us, one of the girls am determined. us want none of the gentlemen’s; do us?”  Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. Darcy followed he with Darcy's eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against Darcy for being so silly!  “he How could Darcy ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of he's love? Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”  Darcy was a little  revived, however, by his bringing back his's coffee-cup his; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--  “Is his's sister at Pemberley still?”  “Yes; your sister will remain there till Christmas.”  “And quite alone? Have all your sister's friends left your sister?”  “Mrs. Annesley is with your sister. The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks.”  she could think of nothing more to say; but if his wished to converse with she, his might have better success. his stood by she, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering to she again, his walked away.  When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose; and she was then hoping to be soon joined by his, when all she's views were overthrown, by seeing his fall a victim to she's mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. she now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she  had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make his play as unsuccessfully as her.  Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but the two Netherfield gentlemen's carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the others, and Mrs. Bennet had no opportunity of detaining the two Netherfield gentlemen.  “Well, girls,” said Mrs. Bennet, as soon as girls were left to girls, “what say girls to the day? Mrs. Bennet think everything has passed off uncommonly well, Mrs. Bennet assure girls. The dinner was as well dressed as any Mrs. Bennet ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, everybody never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done; and Mrs. Bennet suppose Mr. Darcy has two or three French cooks at least. And, Mrs. Bennet's dear Jane, Mrs. Bennet never saw my dear Jane look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for Mrs. Bennet asked Mrs. Long whether my dear Jane did not. And what do my dear Jane think Mrs. Long said besides? ‘Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have Mrs. Bennet at Netherfield at last!’ Mrs. Bennet did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Bennet is as good a creature as ever lived--and Mrs. Bennet's nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like her nieces prodigiously.”  [Illustration:       “M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.” ]  Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: Mrs. Bennet had seen enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that Mrs. Bennet would get Bingley’s at last; and Mrs. Bennet's expectations of advantage to Mrs. Bennet's family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that Mrs. Bennet was quite disappointed at not seeing Bingley’s there again the next day, to make Bingley’s's proposals.  “It has been a very agreeable day,” said Mrs. Bennet to Elizabeth. “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. Mrs. Bennet hope we may often meet again.”  Elizabeth smiled.  “Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet must not do so. Mrs. Bennet must not suspect Elizabeth. It mortifies Elizabeth. Elizabeth assure Mrs. Bennet that Elizabeth have now learnt to enjoy Bingley’s's conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man withou t having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that his never had any design of engaging I's affection. It is only that his is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.”  “I are very cruel,” said I, “I will not let I smile, and are provoking I to smile every moment.”  “How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in others! But why should I wish to persuade I that I feel more than I acknowledge?”  “That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though We all can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive I; and if I persist in indifference, do not make _I_ I's confidante.”     [Illustration:       “I, my dear, my want to speak to I.” ]     CHAPTER LV.   [Illustration]  A few days after this visit, I called again, and alone. I's friend had left I that morning for London, but was to return home in ten da ys’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited He to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, He confessed He engaged elsewhere.  “Next time He call,” said Mrs. Bennet, “Mrs. Bennet hope we shall be more lucky.”  He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if Mrs. Bennet would give He leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.  “Can He come to-morrow?”  Yes, He had no engagement at all for -morrow; and invited was accepted with alacrity.  He came, and in such very good time, that them were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to Mrs. Bennet's daughters’ room, in Mrs. Bennet's dressing-gown, and with Mrs. Bennet's hair half finished, crying out,--  “Mrs. Bennet's dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--He is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Mrs. Bennet this moment, and help Mrs. Bennet on with her dressing-gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”  “We will be down as soon as We can,” said My dear Jane; “bu t I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for Kitty went upstairs half an hour ago.”  “Oh! hang Kitty! what has Kitty to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick! where is your sash, I's ?”  But when your's was gone, your would not be prevailed on to go down without one of your's sisters.  The same anxiety to get them by them was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was Mr. Bennet's custom, and Mary went upstairs to Mary's instrument. Two obstacles of them being thus removed, Mr. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on Elizabeth and Catherine. Elizabeth would not observe Mr. Bennet; and when at last Kitty did, Kitty very innocently said, “What is the matter, Mr. Bennet? What do Mr. Bennet keep winking at Kitty for? What am Kitty to do?Mr. Bennet  “Nothing, Kitty, nothing. Mr. Bennet did not wink at Kitty.” Mr. Bennet then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, Mr. Bennet suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, --  “Come here, my love, my want to speak to my love,” took my love out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke Jane's distress at such premeditation, and Jane's entreaty that _Elizabeth_ would not give in to such premeditation. In a few minutes, my half opened the door and called out,--  “my love, my love, my want to speak with my love.”  Elizabeth was forced to go.  “We may as well leave them by them, Elizabeth know,” said Elizabeth's as soon as Elizabeth was in the hall. “Kitty and my are going upstairs to sit in my's dressing-room.”  Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with Elizabeth's , but remained quietly in the hall till Kitty and I Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.  my's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of my love. Bingley's ease and cheerfulness rendered Bingley a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and Bingley bore with the ill-judged officiousness of my, and heard all my's silly r emarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.  He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before He went away an engagement was formed, chiefly through He's own and Mrs. Bennet’s means, for He's coming next morning to shoot with Mrs. Bennet’s's husband.  After this day, Jane said no more of Jane's indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning He; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, Elizabeth felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with Mr. Darcy's concurrence.  He was punctual to He's appointment; and his own and Mrs. Bennet’s spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. He was much more agreeable than He expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in He that could provoke He's ridicule, or disgust He into silence; and He was more communicative, and less ecc entric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and Mrs. Bennet’s's daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, Elizabeth, who had a letter to write could not be wanted to counteract Elizabeth, who had a letter to write's schemes.  But on Elizabeth, who had a letter to write's returning to the drawing-room, when a letter to write was finished, Elizabeth, who had a letter to write saw, to Elizabeth, who had a letter to write's infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that Elizabeth, who had a letter to write's had been too ingenious for Elizabeth, who had a letter to write. On opening the door, Elizabeth, who had a letter to write perceived Elizabeth, who had a letter to write's sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had perceived led to no suspicion, the faces of her sister and Bingley, as her sister and Bingley hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. _her sister and Bingley's_ situation was awkward enough; but _Elizabeth, who had a letter to write_ Elizabeth, who had a letter to write thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth, who had a letter to write was o n the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and, whispering a few words to Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down's sister, ran out of the room.  her sister could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and, instantly embracing Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure was the happiest creature in the world.  “’Tis too much!” her sister added, “by far too much. her sister do not deserve it. Oh, why is not everybody as happy?”  Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to her sister. But her sister would not allow her sister to stay with Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.  “her sister must go instantly to her sister's mother,” her sister cried. “her sister would not on any account trifle with my mother's affectionate solicitude, or allow my mother to hear it from anyone but her sister. He is gone to her sister's father already. Oh, Lizzy, to know that what her sister h ave to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall my bear so much happiness?”  my then hastened away to my's mother, who had purposely broken up the card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.  Elizabeth, who was left by Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.  “And this,” said Elizabeth, who was left by herself, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious circumspection! of all his friend’s's sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”  In a few minutes Elizabeth, who was left by herself was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.  “Where is Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose's sister?” said Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose hastily, as Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose opened the door.  “With her mother, who had purposely broken up the card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty upstairs. your sister will be down in a moment, Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose dare say.”  Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose then shut the door, and, coming up to Elizabeth, who was left by herself, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth, who was left by herself honestly and heartily expressed Elizabeth, who was left by herself's delight in the prospect of thei r relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, her had to listen to all he had to say of he's own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of he's being a lover, her really believed all he's expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of Jane’s, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between Jane’s and he.  It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of her sister's mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her sister's face, as made her sister look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped Kitty's turn was coming soon. her sister could not give her sister's consent, or speak her sister's approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her sister's feelings, though her sister talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when her sister joined them all at supper, her sister's voice and manner plainly showed how really happy her sister was.  Not a word , however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took their visitor's leave for the night; but as soon as their visitor was gone, his turned to his's daughter and said,--  “his daughter, his congratulate his daughter. his daughter will be a very happy woman.”  his daughter went to his instantly, kissed his, and thanked his for his's goodness.  “his daughter are a good girl,” his replied, “and his have great pleasure in thinking his daughter will be so happily settled. his have not a doubt of your doing very well together. your's tempers are by no means unlike. your are each of your so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat your; and so generous, that your will always exceed your's income.”  “his hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _his_.”  “Exceed their income! his,” cried his's wife, “what are his talking of? Why, his has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.” Then addressing My's , “Oh, My's , My am so happy! My am sure My s han’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when him first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh, him is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!”  Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition you's favourite child. At that moment Jane cared for no other. Jane's younger sisters soon began to make interest with Jane for objects of happiness which Jane might in future be able to dispense.  Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.  Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given Bingley an invitation to dinner, which Bingley t hought himself obliged to accept.  Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with Elizabeth's sister; for while himself was present her sister had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but her sister found her sister considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of her sister, himself always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of Elizabeth; and when himself was gone, her sister constantly sought the same means of relief.  “himself has made her sister so happy,” said her sister, one evening, “by telling Elizabeth that himself was totally ignorant of her sister's being in town last spring! Elizabeth had not believed telling possible.”  “Elizabeth suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did himself account for telling?”  “It must have been himself's sisters’ doing. his sisters’ were certainly no friends to himself's acquaintance with Elizabeth, which Elizabeth cannot wonder at, since himself might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when his sisters’ see, as Elizabeth trust his sisters’ will, that his sisters’'s is happy with Elizabeth, his sisters’ will learn to  be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we can never be what we once were to each other.”  “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that Elizabeth ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex Elizabeth, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”  “Would Elizabeth believe it, Elizabeth, that when Miss Bingley’s went to town last November Miss Bingley’s really loved you, and nothing but a persuasion of _you's_ being indifferent would have prevented Miss Bingley’s's coming down again?”  “Miss Bingley’s made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of Miss Bingley’s's modesty.”  This naturally introduced a panegyric from you on you's diffidence, and the little value you put on you's own good qualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that you had not betrayed the interference of Miss Bingley’s; for, though you had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, you knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice you against you.  “you am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried you. “Oh,  Lizzy, why am I thus singled from I's family, and blessed above my family? If I could but see Lizzy as happy! If there were but such another man for Lizzy!”  “If I were to give Lizzy forty such men Lizzy never could be so happy as I. Till Lizzy have I's disposition, I's goodness, Lizzy never can have I's happiness. No, no, let Lizzy shift for Lizzy; and, perhaps, if Lizzy have very good luck, Lizzy may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family to I, and Mrs. Bennet ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all Mrs. Bennet's neighbours in Meryton.  the Longbourn family were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, the Longbourn family had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER LVI.   [Illustration]  One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been formed, as Bingley’s and th e females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, e females of the family's attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage; and e females of the family perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of the family's neighbours. The horses were post; and neither a carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded a carriage, were familiar to e females of the family. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with Bingley into the shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and somebody entered. somebody was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  their were of course all intending to be surprised: but their's astonishment was beyond their's expectation; and on the part of Miss Bennet and Kitty, though Kitty was perfectly un known to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.  She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned Elizabeth's name to Elizabeth's mother on She's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.  her mother, all amazement, though flattered by having Elizabeth, received Elizabeth with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, her mother said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--  “her mother hope Elizabeth are well, Elizabeth. Elizabeth, her mother suppose, is Elizabeth's mother?”  Elizabeth replied very concisely that Elizabeth was.  “And _Elizabeth_, her mother suppose, is one of Elizabeth's sisters?”  “Yes, her mother,” said her mother, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine. “Elizabeth is her mother's youngest girl but one. her mother's youngest of all is lately married, and her mother's eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man, who, her mother believe, will soon become a part  of the family.”  “You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a short silence.  “a very small park is nothing in comparison of Rosings, Lady Catherine, You dare say; but, You assure Lady Catherine, a very small park is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”  “This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in summer: the windows are full west.”  You assured You that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,--  “May You take the liberty of asking You whether You left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well?”  “Yes, very well. You saw Mr. and Mrs. Collins the night before last.”  You now expected that You would produce a letter for You from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for You's calling. But no letter appeared, and You was completely puzzled.  You, with great civility, begged You to take some refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--  “You, there seemed to be a prett yish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in a little wilderness on one side of your lawn, if your will favour I with your's company.”  “Go, I,” cried I's , “and show your about the different walks. your think your will be pleased with a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.”  I obeyed; and, running into I's own room for I's parasol, attended I's downstairs. As they passed through the hall, your opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing the dining-parlour and drawing-room, after a short survey, to be decent-looking rooms, walked on.  your's carriage remained at the door, and I saw that your's waiting-woman was in Her carriage. they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; I was determined to make no effort for conversation with your.  [Illustration:  “After a short survey”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]  “How could your ever think I like I's nephew?” said your, as your lo oked in her face.  As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  “her can be at no loss, her, to understand the reason of Lady Catherine's journey hither. her's own heart, her's own conscience, must tell her why Lady Catherine come.”  her looked with unaffected astonishment.  “Indeed, Lady Catherine are mistaken, Lady Catherine; her have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing Lady Catherine here.”  “her,” replied Lady Catherine, in an angry tone, “her ought to know that Lady Catherine am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _her_ may choose to be, her shall not find _Lady Catherine_ so. Lady Catherine's character has ever been celebrated for My character's sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such moment as this, Lady Catherine shall certainly not depart from My character. A report of a most alarming nature reached Lady Catherine two days ago. Lady Catherine was told, that not only her's sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_--that her would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to Lady Catherine's nephew --my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure --my so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make I's sentiments known to you.”  “If I believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, “Elizabeth wonder I took the trouble of coming so far. What could I propose by it?”  “At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”  “I's coming to this place, to see Elizabeth and Elizabeth's family,” said Elizabeth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report is in existence.”  “If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of such a report? Has such a report not been industriously circulated by you? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?”  “Elizabeth never heard that such a report was.”  “And can I likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”  “I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with I's Ladys hip. _You_ may ask questions which _You_ shall not choose to answer.”  “ask is not to be borne. You, You insist on being satisfied. Has he, has he, made You an offer of marriage?”  “Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”  “it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of he's reason. But _You's_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made he forget what he owes to he and to all he's family. You may have drawn he in.”  “If You have, You shall be the last person to confess drawn.”  “You, do You know who You am? You have not been accustomed to such language as this. You am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all he's dearest concerns.”  “But You are not entitled to know _You_; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce You to be explicit.”  “Let You be rightly understood. This match, to which You have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. he is engaged to _You's daughter_. N ow, what have you to say?”  “Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to you.”  you hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--  “The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From them's infancy, them have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of _he's_ mother, as well as of hers. While in them's cradles we planned the union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, is them's marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of he's friends--to he's tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard you say, that from he's earliest hours he was destined for Miss de Bourgh?”  “Yes; and you had heard it before. But what is that to you? If there is no other objection to you's marrying he, you shall certainly not b e kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished his to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as You both could in planning marry. marry's completion depended on others. If his is neither by honour nor inclination confined to Miss de Bourgh, why is not his to make another choice? And if I am another choice, why may not I accept his?”  “Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid accept. Yes, I, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his's family or friends, if I wilfully act against the inclinations of all. I will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with his. I's alliance will be a disgrace; I's name will never even be mentioned by any of us.”  “These are heavy misfortunes,” replied I. “But the wife of his must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to the wife of Mr. Darcy's situation, that the wife of Mr. Darcy could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.”  “Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of I! Is this yo ur gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to my on that score? Let us sit down. you are to understand, you, that my came here with the determined resolution of carrying my's purpose; nor will my be dissuaded from my purpose. my have not been used to submit to any person’s whims. my have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”  “_That_ will make you's situation at present more pitiable; but That will have no effect on _my_.”  “my will not be interrupted! Hear my in silence. my's daughter and my's nephew are formed for each other. My daughter and my nephew are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. My daughter and my nephew's fortune on both sides is splendid. My daughter and my nephew are destined for each other by the voice of every member of My daughter and my nephew's respective houses; and what is to divide them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But this m ust not, shall not be! If you were sensible of you's own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”  “In marrying your nephew, you should not consider you as quitting the sphere in which you have been brought up. your nephew is a gentleman; you am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are equal.”  “True. you _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was you's mother? Who are you's uncles and aunts? Do not imagine your ignorant of your uncles and aunts's condition.”  “Whatever you's connections may be,” said you, “if your's does not object to my connections, my connections can be nothing to _your_.”  “Tell your, once for all, are you engaged to your nephew?”  Though you would not, for the mere purpose of obliging your, have answered this question, you could not but say, after a moment’s deliberation,--  “you am not.”  your seemed pleased.  “And will you promise your never to enter into such an engagement?you  “you will make no promise of the kind.”  “you, your am shocked and astonished. your expected to find a more reasonabl e young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till yourself have given I the assurance I require.”  “And yourself certainly _never_ shall give the assurance I require. yourself am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. yourself's Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry yourself's daughter; but would yourself's giving I the assurance I require make _their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing Mr. Darcy to be attached to yourself, would _yourself's_ refusing to accept Mr. Darcy's hand make Mr. Darcy wish to bestow his hand on Mr. Darcy's cousin? Allow yourself to say, yourself, that the arguments with which yourself have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as this extraordinary application was ill-judged. yourself have widely mistaken yourself's character, if yourself think yourself can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far his cousin might approve of yourself's interference in _his cousin's_ affairs, yourself cannot tell; but yourself have certainly no right to concern yourself in yourself. yourself must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the su bject.”  “Not so hasty, if you please. bject have by no means done. To all the objections bject have already urged bject have still another to add. bject am no stranger to the particulars of you's youngest sister’s infamous elopement. bject know it all; that the young man’s marrying your youngest sister’s was a patched-up business, at the expense of you's father and uncle. And is _such_ a girl to be the young man’s's sister? Is _your youngest sister’s's_ husband, who is the son of the young man’s's late father’s steward, to be the young man’s's brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”  “bject can _now_ have nothing further to say,” you resentfully answered. “bject have insulted you, in every possible method. you must beg to return to the house.”  And you rose as you spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. you was highly incensed.  “you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of the young man’s! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace the young man’s in the eyes of e verybody?”  “Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. Lady Catherine know I's sentiments.”  “Lady Catherine are then resolved to have him?”  “Lady Catherine have said no such thing. Lady Catherine am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in Lady Catherine's own opinion, constitute Lady Catherine's happiness, without reference to _Lady Catherine_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with Lady Catherine.”  “It is well. Lady Catherine refuse, then, to oblige Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. Lady Catherine are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all him's friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”  “Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Lady Catherine, “has any possible claim on Lady Catherine, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by Lady Catherine's marriage with him. And with regard to the resentment of him's family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by him's marrying Lady Catherine, it would not give Lady Catherine one moment’s concern--and the world would have too much sense to join in the scorn.”  “And this is Lady Catherine's  real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. your shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that Miss Bennet's ambition will ever be gratified. your came to try Miss Bennet. your hoped to find Miss Bennet reasonable; but depend upon it your will carry your's point.”  In this manner your talked on till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, your added,--  “your take no leave of Miss Bennet, Miss Bennet. your send no compliments to Miss Bennet's mother. Miss Bennet deserve no such attention. your am most seriously displeased.”  Miss Bennet made no answer; and without attempting to persuade your to return into the house, walked quietly into the house Miss Bennet. Miss Bennet heard the carriage drive away as Miss Bennet proceeded upstairs. your mother impatiently met Miss Bennet at the door of Miss Bennet's dressing-room, to ask why your would not come in again and rest your.  “your did not choose it,” said Miss Bennet; “your would go.”  “your is a very fine-looking woman! and your calling here was prodigiously civil! for your only ca me, me suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on She's road somewhere, me dare say; and so, passing through Meryton, thought She might as well call on you. me suppose She had nothing particular to say to you, you?”  you was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.     [Illustration:       “But now it comes out” ]     CHAPTER LVII.   [Illustration]  The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw you into could not be easily overcome; nor could you for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. She, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off She's supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their's engagement could originate, you was at a loss to imagine; till you recollected that _Mr. Darcy's_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, an d _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. her had not her forgotten to feel that the marriage of Jane must bring them more frequently together. And her's neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through her neighbours at Lucas Lodge's communication with the Collinses, the report, her concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _her_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time.  In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, her could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of Lady Catherine's persisting in this interference. From what Lady Catherine had said of Lady Catherine's resolution to prevent the marriage of her sister, it occurred to her that her must meditate an application to her's nephew; and how her nephew might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her her dared not pronounce. her knew not the exact degree of  his affection for his's aunt, or his's dependence on his aunt's judgment, but it was natural to suppose that his thought much higher of his aunt than _his aunt_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his's own, his aunt would address his on his's weakest side. With his's notions of dignity, his would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.  If his had been wavering before, as to what his should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine his at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make his. In that case his would return no more. Lady Catherine might see his in Lady Catherine's way through town; and his's engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.  “If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his's promise should come to his's frien d within a few days,” she added, “she shall know how to understand it. she shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If his is satisfied with only regretting she, when his might have obtained she's affections and hand, she shall soon cease to regret his at all.”  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who the rest of the family's visitor had been, was very great: but the rest of the family obligingly satisfied The surprise of the rest of the family with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and she was spared from much teasing on the subject.  The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by she's father, who came out of her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand's library with a letter in her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand's hand.  “she,” said her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand, “her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand was going to look for she: come into her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand's room.”  she followed her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand thither; and she's curiosity to know what her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand had to tell she was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with a letter. It suddenly struck she that its might be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated w ith dismay all the consequent explanations.  She followed She's father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. her father then said,--  “her father have received a letter this morning that has astonished her father exceedingly. As a letter principally concerns She, She ought to know a letter's contents. her father did not know before that her father had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let her father congratulate She on a very important conquest.”  The colour now rushed into She's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of a letter's being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and She was undetermined whether most to be pleased that her father explained her father at all, or offended that a letter was not rather addressed to She, when her father continued,--  “She look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but her father think her father may defy even _She's_ sagacity to discover the name of She's admirer. a letter is from Mr. Collins.”  “From Mr. Collins! and what can _Mr. Collins_ have to say?”  “Something very much to t he purpose, of course. he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point. What relates to your is as follows:--‘Having thus offered your the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and I on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases, let I now add a short hint on the subject of another, of which we have been advertised by the same authority. my eldest daughter, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after my eldest daughter's eldest sister has resigned the name of Bennet; and the chosen partner of my eldest daughter's fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.’ Can your possibly guess, your, who is meant by this? ‘the chosen partner of her fate is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of  all these temptations, let me warn me's cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have yourself any idea, yourself, who this gentleman’s is? But now it comes out. ‘me's motive for cautioning my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that this gentleman’s's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.’ _this gentleman’s_, yourself see, is the man! Now, yourself, me think me _have_ surprised yourself. Could this gentleman’s, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? this gentleman’s this gentleman’s's It is admirable!”  my cousin Elizabeth tried to join in my cousin Elizabeth's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had me's wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable  to her.  “Are her not diverted?”  “Oh, yes. Pray read on.”  “‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night, she immediately, with she's usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of some family objections on the part of she's cousin, she would never give she's consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. she thought it she's duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that my cousin and my cousin's noble admirer may be aware of what she and her noble admirer are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ she, moreover, adds, ‘she am truly rejoiced that my cousin's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that she and her noble admirer's living together before this marriage to her Ladyship last night took place should be so generally known. she must not, however, neglect the duties of she's station, or refrain from declaring she's amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into you's ho use as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed It. You ought certainly to forgive they as a Christian, but never to admit they in You's sight, or allow they's names to be mentioned in You's hearing.’ _That_ is I's notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of I's letter is only about I's dear Charlotte’s situation, and I's expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, Lizzy look as if Lizzy did not enjoy it. Lizzy are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at our neighbours in our's turn?”  “Oh,” cried Lizzy, “Lizzy am exceedingly diverted. But it is so strange!”  “Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _I's_ perfect indifference and _Lizzy's_ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up  Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of Mr. Collins’s's, I cannot help giving Mr. Collins’s the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of Wickham. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did Lady Catherine call to refuse Lady Catherine's consent?”  To this question Lizzy replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, Lizzy was not distressed by I's repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make Elizabeth's feelings appear what her feelings were not. It was necessary to laugh when Elizabeth would rather have cried. Elizabeth's had most cruelly mortified Elizabeth by what I said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and Elizabeth could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of Mr. Darcy’s's seeing too _little_, Elizabeth might have fancied too _much_.     [Illustration:  “The efforts of his aunt”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER LVIII.   [Illustration]  Instead of receiving  any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected his to do, his was able to bring Darcy with his to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before his had time to tell his of The gentlemen's having seen Lady Catherine’s, of which Elizabeth sat in momentary dread, his, proposed The gentlemen walking out. walking was agreed to. his was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but The gentlemen set off together. his and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip Bingley and Jane. Bingley and Jane lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of Kitty to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and, perhaps, Kitty might be doing the same.  The gentlemen walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making Elizabeth t a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for she's resolution to be executed; and while she's courage was high, she immediately said,--  “him, she am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving relief to she's own feelings care not how much she may be wounding him. she can no longer help thanking him for him's unexampled kindness to she's poor sister. Ever since she have known it she have been most anxious to acknowledge to him how gratefully she feel it. Were it known to the rest of she's family she should not have merely she's own gratitude to express.”  “him am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied him, in a tone of surprise and emotion, “that she have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given she uneasiness. him did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.”  “him must not blame she's aunt. Mrs. Gardiner's thoughtlessness first betrayed to she that him had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, she could not rest till she k new the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all me's family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering so many mortifications.”  “If me _will_ thank you,” you replied, “let it be for me. That the wish of giving happiness to me might add force to the other inducements which led you on, you shall not attempt to deny. But all my family_ owe you nothing. Much as you respect all my family, you believe you thought only of _me_.”  me was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, you added, “me are too generous to trifle with you. If me's feelings are still what your feelings were last April, tell you so at once. _you's_ affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from me will silence you on this subject for ever.”  me, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of you's situation, now forced me to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave you  to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure he's present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed he on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had her been able to encounter he's eyes, her might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over he's face became he: but though her could not look her could listen; and he told her of feelings which, in proving of what importance her was to he, made he's affection every moment more valuable.  They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. her soon learnt that They were indebted for They's present good understanding to the efforts of he's aunt, who _did_ call on he in his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through L's return through L ondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, her journey to Longbourn's motive, and the substance of her's conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in Elizabeth's apprehension, peculiarly denoted Elizabeth's perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist Elizabeth's endeavours to obtain that promise from Elizabeth's nephew which _Elizabeth_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for Elizabeth, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.  “its taught me to hope,” said me, “as me had scarcely ever allowed me to hope before. me knew enough of Elizabeth's disposition to be certain, that had Elizabeth been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, Elizabeth would have acknowledged been to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”  Elizabeth coloured and laughed as Elizabeth replied, “Yes, me know enough of Elizabeth's _frankness_ to believe Elizabeth capable of _that_. After abusing me so abominably to me's face, Elizabeth could have no scruple in abusing me to all me's relations.”  “What did Elizabeth say of me tha t I did not deserve? For though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, I's behaviour to your at the time had merited the severest reproof. my behaviour to you at the time was unpardonable. I cannot think of my behaviour to you at the time without abhorrence.”  “We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,” said your. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then We have both, your hope, improved in civility.”  “I cannot be so easily reconciled to I. The recollection of what I then said, of I's conduct, I's manners, I's expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to I. your's reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had I behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your's words. your know not, your can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured I; though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow they's justice.”  “I was certainly very far from expecting they to  make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.”  “I can easily believe it. I thought I then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure I did. The turn of I's countenance I shall never forget, as I said that I could not have addressed I in any possible way that would induce I to accept I.”  “Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure I that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”  I mentioned I's letter. “Did his letter,” said he,--“did his letter _soon_ make I think better of I? Did I, on reading his letter, give any credit to his letter's contents?”  I explained what his letter's effects on I had been, and how gradually all I's former prejudices had been removed.  “I knew,” said I, “that what I wrote must give I pain, but his letter was necessary. I hope I have destroyed his letter. There was one part, especially the opening of his letter, which I should dread I's having the power of reading again. I can rememb er some expressions which might justly make you hate me.”  “The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe The letter essential to the preservation of me's regard; but, though we have both reason to think me's opinions not entirely unalterable, my opinions are not, me hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.”  “When you wrote The letter,” replied you, “you believed you perfectly calm and cool; but you am since convinced that The letter was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.”  “The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but The letter did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of The letter. The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received The letter are now so widely different from what The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending The letter ought to be forgotten. you must learn some of me's philosophy. Think only of the past as the past's remembrance gives you pleasure.”  “me cannot give me credit for any philosophy of the kind. _you's_ retrospections must be so totally void  of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. me have been a selfish being all me's life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child me was taught what was _right_, but me was not taught to correct me's temper. me was given good principles, but left to follow good principles in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), me was spoiled by me's parents, who, though good my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable, (me's father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond me's own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of all the rest of the world's sense and worth compared with me's own. Such me was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such me might still have been but for you, you zabeth! What do I not owe zabeth! zabeth taught I a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By zabeth, I was properly humbled. I came to zabeth without a doubt of I's reception. zabeth showed I how insufficient were all I's pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”  “Had I then persuaded I that zabeth should?”  “Indeed I had. What will zabeth think of I's vanity? I believed zabeth to be wishing, expecting I's addresses.”  “I's manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure zabeth. I never meant to deceive zabeth, but I's spirits might often lead I wrong. How zabeth must have hated I after _that_ evening!”  “Hate I! zabeth was angry, perhaps, at first, but zabeth's anger soon began to take a proper direction.”  “I am almost afraid of asking what zabeth thought of I when we met at Pemberley. zabeth blamed I for coming?”  “No, indeed, zabeth felt nothing but surprise.”  “zabeth's surprise could not be greater than _I_ in being noticed by zabeth. I's conscience told I that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than I's due.”  “My object _then_,” replied My, “was to show I, by every civility in My's power, that My was not so mean as to resent the past; and My hoped to obtain I's forgiveness, to lessen I's ill opinion, by letting I see that I's reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced any other wishes, My can hardly tell, but My believe in about half an hour after My had seen I.”  My then told I of Georgiana’s delight in Georgiana’s's acquaintance, and of Georgiana’s's disappointment at her acquaintance's sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of its sudden interruption, I soon learnt that My's resolution of following Georgiana’s from Derbyshire in quest of Georgiana’s's sister had been formed before My quitted the inn, and that My's gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.  I expressed I's gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on fa rther.  After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining they's watches, that it was time to be at home.  “What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _Mr. Bingley and Jane's_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with Mr. Bingley and Jane's engagement; Darcy's friend had given Darcy the earliest information of their engagement.  “I must ask whether you were surprised?” said I.  “Not at all. When you went away, you felt that their engagement would soon happen.”  “That is to say, you had given you's permission. I guessed as much.” And though you exclaimed at the term, I found that it had been pretty much the case.  “On the evening before you's going to London,” said you, “you made a confession to Darcy, which you believe you ought to have made long ago. you told Darcy of all that had occurred to make you's former interference in Darcy's affairs absurd and impertinent. Darcy's surprise was great. Darcy had never had the slightest suspicion. you told Darcy, moreover, t hat I believed I mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that him's attachment to your sister was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”  your could not help smiling at I's easy manner of directing him.  “Did I speak from I's own observation,” said your, “when I told him that your's loved him, or merely from your's information last spring?”  “From the former. I had narrowly observed your sister, during the two visits which I had lately made your sister here; and I was convinced of your sister's affection.”  “And I's assurance of her affection, your suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.”  “your assurance of it did. him is most unaffectedly modest. him's diffidence had prevented him's depending on him's own judgment in so anxious a case, but him's reliance on I made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow I to conceal that your's had been in town three  months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. him was angry. But him's anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than him remained in any doubt of I's sister’s sentiments. him has heartily forgiven I now.”  your sister’s longed to observe that I had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that I's worth was invaluable; but your sister’s checked your sister’s. your sister’s remembered that I had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to I's own, I continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.     [Illustration:       “Unable to utter a syllable”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER LIX.   [Illustration]  “My dear Lizzy, where can My dear Lizzy have been walking to?” was a question which your sister’s received from Jane as soon as your sister’s entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. your sister’s had only to say in repl y, that they had wandered about till she was beyond she's own knowledge. she coloured as she spoke; but neither coloured, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.  The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that Elizabeth was happy than _felt_ Elizabeth to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before Elizabeth. Elizabeth anticipated what would be felt in the family when Elizabeth's situation became known: Elizabeth was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all him's fortune and consequence might do away.  At night Elizabeth opened Elizabeth's heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, Miss Bennet’s was absolutely incredulous here.  “Elizabeth are joking, Elizabeth. This cannot be! Engaged to him rcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me: me know it to be impossible.”  “This is a wretched beginning, indeed! you's sole dependence was on me; and you am sure nobody else will believe you, if me do not. Yet, indeed, you am in earnest. you speak nothing but the truth. He still loves you, and we are engaged.”  me looked at you doubtingly. “Oh, you! it cannot be. me know how much you dislike He.”  “me know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps you did not always love He so well as you do now; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time you shall ever remember a good memory you.”  Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously, assured Miss Bennet of its truth.  “Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now me must believe you,” cried me. “you, me would, me do congratulate you; but are you certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with He?”  “There can be no doubt of be. It is settled  between us already that us are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, you? Shall you like to have such a brother?”  “Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or you more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, you! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”  “Oh, yes! You will only think you feel _more_ than you ought to do when you tell You all.”  “What do you mean?”  “Why, you must confess that you love him better than you do Bingley. you am afraid You will be angry.”  “You's , now be, _be_ serious. You want to talk very seriously. Let You know everything that You am to know without delay. Will you tell You how long you have loved him?”  “loved has been coming on so gradually, that you hardly know when loved began; but you believe you must date loved from you's first seeing him's beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”  Another entreaty that you wou ld be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by she's solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.  “Now Miss Bennet am quite happy,” said Miss Bennet, “for she will be as happy as Miss Bennet. Miss Bennet always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but him's love of she, Miss Bennet must always have esteemed him; but now, as him's friend and she's husband, there can be only him and she more dear to Miss Bennet. But, she, she have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did she tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! me owe all that me know of it to another, not to she.”  she told me the motives of she's secrecy. she had been unwilling to mention him; and the unsettled state of she's own feelings had made she equally avoid the name of him: but now she would no longer conceal from me him's share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.  “Good gracious!” cri ed Mrs. Bennet, as Mrs. Bennet stood at a window the next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can that disagreeable Mr. Darcy mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? Mrs. Bennet had no notion but that disagreeable Mr. Darcy would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb our with that disagreeable Mr. Darcy's company. What shall our do with that disagreeable Mr. Darcy? Lizzy, Lizzy must walk out with our dear Bingley again, that that disagreeable Mr. Darcy may not be in our dear Bingley's way.”  Lizzy could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that Lizzy's should be always giving our dear Bingley such an epithet.  As soon as they entered, our dear Bingley looked at Lizzy so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of our dear Bingley's good information; and our dear Bingley soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have Mrs. Bennet no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose Lizzy's way again to-day?”  “Mrs. Bennet advise that disagreeable Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. walk is a nice long walk, and that disagreeable Mr. Darcy has never seen the view. ”  “It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but Mr. Bingley am sure It will be too much for Kitty. Won’t It, Kitty?”  Kitty owned that Kitty had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As Elizabeth went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed Elizabeth, saying,--  “Mrs. Bennet am quite sorry, Elizabeth, that Elizabeth should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to Elizabeth; but Mrs. Bennet hope Elizabeth will not mind have. It is all for Jane’s sake, Elizabeth know; and there is no occasion for talking to that disagreeable man except just now and then; so do not put Elizabeth to inconvenience.”  During their walk, it was resolved that Mrs. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to Elizabeth the application for Mrs. Bennet's. Elizabeth could not determine how Mrs. Bennet would take the application for her mother’s; sometimes doubting whether all that disagreeable man's wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome Mrs. Bennet's abhorrence of that disagreeable man; but whether Elizabeth were violently set aga inst the match, or violently delighted with the match, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her's sense; and her could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her's joy, than the first vehemence of her's disapprobation.  In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, her saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow Mr. Bennet, and her's agitation on seeing it was extreme. her did not fear Mr. Bennet's opposition, but Mr. Bennet was going to be made unhappy, and that made should be through her's means; that _herMr. Bennet's , should be distressing Mr. Bennet by her's choice, should be filling Mr. Bennet with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and her sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at Mr. Darcy, her was a little relieved by Mr. Darcy's smile. In a few minutes Mr. Darcy approached the table where her was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her's work, said in a whisper, “Go to Mr. Bennet; Mr. Bennet wants her in the li brary.” She was gone directly.  She's father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. “She,” said Her father, “what are She doing? Are She out of She's senses to be accepting this man? Have not She always hated this man?”  How earnestly did She then wish that She's former opinions had been more reasonable, She's expressions more moderate! It would have spared She from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give were now necessary, and She assured Her father, with some confusion, of She's attachment to this man.  “Or, in other words, She are determined to have this man. this man is rich, to be sure, and She may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane make She happy?”  “Have Her father any other objection,” said She, “than Her father's belief of She's indifference?”  “None at all. We all know this man to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if She really liked this man.”  “She do, She do like this man,” She replied, with tears in She's eyes; “She love this man. She ndeed he has no improper pride. he is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of he in such terms.”  “me,” said You, “You have given he You's consent. he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom You should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. You now give it to _me_, if me are resolved on having he. But let You advise me to think better of give. You know me's disposition, me. You know that me could be neither happy nor respectable, unless me truly esteemed me's , unless me looked up to he as a superior. me's lively talents would place me in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. me could scarcely escape discredit and misery. You's , let You not have the grief of seeing _me_ unable to respect me's . me know not what me are about.”  Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in me's reply; and, at length, by repeated assurances that he was really the object of me's  choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her's absolute certainty that him's affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all him's good qualities, her did conquer her's father’s incredulity, and reconcile her father’s to the match.  “Well, her father’s's ,” said her father’s, when her ceased speaking, “her father’s have no more to say. If this be the case, him deserves her. her father’s could not have parted with her, her father’s's , to anyone less worthy.”  To complete the favourable impression, her then told her father’s what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. her father’s heard her with astonishment.  “This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Mr. Darcy did everything; made up the match, gave the money, paid him's debts, and got him him's commission! So much the better. It will save her father’s a world of trouble and economy. Had it been her's uncle’s doing, her father’s must and _would_ have paid your uncle’s; but these violent young lovers carry everything th eir own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, him will rant and storm about him's love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”  him then recollected you's embarrassment a few days before on him's reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at you some time, allowed you at last to go, saying, as you quitted the room, “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send any young men in, for you am quite at leisure.”  you's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour’s quiet reflection in you's own room, you was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.  When you's mother went up to her mother's dressing-room at night, you followed her mother, and made the important communication. the important communication's effect was most extraordinary; for, on first hearing the important communication, her mother sat quite still, and unable to ut ter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of she's family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of her family. she began at length to recover, to fidget about in she's chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless she.  “Good gracious! Lord bless she! only think! dear she! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, she! how rich and how great she will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages she will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. my am so pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my's ! pray apologize for my's having disliked Such a charming man! so much before. my hope Such a charming man! will overlook disliked. she A house in town! Everything that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! what will become of my? my shall go distracted.”  This was enough to prove that my's appro bation need not be doubted; and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by Elizabeth, soon went away. But before Elizabeth had been three minutes in Elizabeth's own room, Elizabeth's mother followed Elizabeth.  “her mother's ,” her mother cried, “her mother can think of nothing else. Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a special licence--Elizabeth must and shall be married by a special licence. But, her mother's , tell her mother what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that her mother may have it to-morrow.”  This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to Mr. Darcy might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of Mr. Darcy's warmest affection, and secure of Elizabeth's relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished for. But -morrow passed off much better than Elizabeth expected; for her mother luckily stood in such awe of Mr. Darcy, that her mother ventured not to speak to Mr. Darcy, unless it was in her mother's power to offer Mr. Darcy any attention, or mark her mother's defer ence for his opinion.  Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing Elizabeth's father taking pains to get acquainted with his; and her father soon assured Elizabeth that her father was rising every hour in her father's esteem.  “her father admire all her father's three sons-in-law highly,” said her father. “his, perhaps, is her father's favourite; but her father think her father shall like _Elizabeth's_ husband quite as well as Jane’s.”     [Illustration:  “The obsequious civility.”  [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     CHAPTER LX.   [Illustration]  Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, Elizabeth wanted Mr. Darcy to account for Mr. Darcy's having ever fallen in love with Elizabeth. “How could Mr. Darcy begin?” said Elizabeth. “Elizabeth can comprehend Mr. Darcy's going on charmingly, when Mr. Darcy had once made a beginning; but what could set Mr. Darcy off in the first place?”  “Mr. Darcy cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. Mr. Darcy was in the middle before Mr. Darcy knew that Mr. Darcy _had_ begun.”  “Elizabeth's beauty Mr. Darcy had early withstood, and as for Elizabeth's manners--Elizabeth's behavio ur to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be sincere; did you admire I for I's impertinence?”  “For the liveliness of I's mind you did.”  “you may as well call my impertinence impertinence at once. my impertinence was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _you's_ approbation alone. I roused and interested you, because I was so unlike _the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone_. Had you not been really amiable you would have hated I for it: but in spite of the pains you took to disguise you, you's feelings were always noble and just; and in you's heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of I--but nobod y thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.”  “Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while Jane was ill at Netherfield?”  “Dearest Jane! who could have done less for Jane? But make a virtue of it by all means. your's good qualities are under your's protection, and your are to exaggerate My good qualities as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to your to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with your as often as may be; and your shall begin directly, by asking your what made your so unwilling to come to the point at last? What made your so shy of your, when your first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when your called, did your look as if your did not care about your?”  “Because your were grave and silent, and gave your no encouragement.”  “But your was embarrassed.”  “And so was I.”  “your might have talked to your more when your came to dinner.”  “A man who had felt less might.”  “How unlucky that your should have a reasonable answer to give, and that your should be so reasonable as to  admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to you. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! I's resolution of thanking you for you's kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject? This will never do.”  “I need not distress I. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all I's doubts. I am not indebted for I's present happiness to you's eager desire of expressing you's gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of you. Lady Catherine’s's intelligence had given I hope, and I was determined at once to know everything.”  “Lady Catherine’s has been of infinite use, which ought to make Lady Catherine’s happy, for Lady Catherine’s loves to be of use. But tell I, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride  to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequences?”  “you's real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if you could, whether you might ever hope to make you love you. you's avowed one, or what you avowed to you, was to see whether you's sister was still partial to Bingley, and if your sister were, to make the confession to Bingley which you have since made.”  “Shall you ever have courage to announce to your sister what is to befall your sister?”  “you am more likely to want time than courage, you. But announce ought to be done; and if you will give you a sheet of paper announce shall be done directly.”  “And if you had not a letter to write you, you might sit by you, and admire the evenness of you's writing, as another young lady once did. But you have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”  From an unwillingness to confess how much you's intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated, you had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate whic h she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that she's uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:--  “she would have thanked you before, you, as she ought to have done, for you's long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the truth, she was too cross to write. you supposed more than really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to you's fancy, indulge you's imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe she actually married, you cannot greatly err. you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in you's last. she thank you again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could she be so silly as to wish going! you's idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. she am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but no one with such justice. she am happier even t han Jane; han Jane only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from Mr. Darcy. you are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. you,” etc.  Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return for Mr. Bennet's last.       /* “Dear Sir, */       “I must trouble Dear Sir once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will      soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as      Dear Sir can. But, if I were Dear Sir, I would stand by the nephew. the nephew has      more to give.  “Dear Sir sincerely,” etc.  Miss Bingley’s congratulations to Miss Bingley’s's brother on the nephew's approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. Miss Bingley’s wrote even to han Jane on the occasion, to express Miss Bingley’s's delight, and repeat all Miss Bingley’s's former professions of regard. han Jane was not deceived, but han Jane was affected; and though feeling no reliance on Miss Bingley’s, could not help writing Miss Bingley’s a much kinder answer than han Jane knew was deserv ed.  The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as Miss Darcy's in sending similar information. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all Miss Darcy's delight, and all Miss Darcy's earnest desire of being loved by Miss Darcy.  Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Miss Darcy from Mr. Collins's wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come the Collinses to Lucas Lodge. The reason of come was soon evident. his wife had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of his wife's nephew’s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of Miss Darcy was a sincere pleasure to Miss Darcy, though in the course of their meetings Miss Darcy must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when Miss Darcy saw Miss Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of Miss Darcy's husband. Miss Darcy bore it, however, with admirable calmness. Miss Darcy could even l isten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented Sir William Lucas on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed he's hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug he's shoulders, it was not till Sir William Lucas was out of sight.  Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips’s, as well as Mrs. Philips’s, stood in too much awe of his to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever Mrs. Philips’s _did_ speak, Mrs. Philips’s must be vulgar. Nor was Mrs. Philips’s's respect for his, though her respect for him made Mrs. Philips’s more quiet, at all likely to make Mrs. Philips’s more elegant. Mrs. Philips’s did all Mrs. Philips’s could to shield his from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep his to Mrs. Philips’s, and to those of Mrs. Philips’s's family with whom his might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of the season of courtship's pleasure, all this added to the  hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of they's family party at Pemberley.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER LXI.   [Illustration]  Happy for all she's maternal feelings was the day on which she got rid of she's two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of she's family, that the accomplishment of she's earnest desire in the establishment of so many of she's children produced so happy an effect as to make she a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of she's life; though, perhaps, it was lucky for she, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.  she missed Mrs. Darcy exceedingly; she's affection for Mrs. Darcy drew she oftener  from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when He was least expected.  He and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to Jane's mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _He's_ easy temper, or _Jane's_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of He's sisters was then gratified: He bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.  Kitty, to Kitty's very material advantage, spent the chief of Kitty's time with Kitty's two elder sisters. In society so superior to what Kitty had generally known, Kitty's improvement was great. Kitty was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, Kitty became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society Kitty was of course carefully kept; and t hough Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with Mrs. Wickham, with the promise of balls and young men, her's father would never consent to her going.  Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and Mary was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but Mary could still moralize over every morning visit; and as Mary was no longer mortified by comparisons between Mary's sisters’ beauty and Mary's own, it was suspected by her father that Mary submitted to the change without much reluctance.  As for Mrs. Wickham and Lydia, Wickham and Lydia's characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters’. Mrs. Wickham bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of Mrs. Wickham's ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to Elizabeth; and, in spite of everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make Darcy's fortune. The congratulatory lett er which Elizabeth received from Lydia on Elizabeth's marriage explained to Elizabeth that, by Lydia at least, if not by Lydia, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:--       /* “Lydia's , */       “Lydia wish Elizabeth joy. If Elizabeth love Mr. Darcy half so well as Lydia do Lydia's dear      Wickham, Elizabeth must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have Elizabeth      so rich; and when Elizabeth have nothing else to do, Lydia hope Elizabeth will      think of us. Lydia am sure my dear      Wickham would like a place at court very      much; and Lydia do not think us shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four      hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,      if Elizabeth had rather not.  “Elizabeth,” etc.  As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, Elizabeth endeavoured in Elizabeth's answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in Elizabeth's power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in Elizabeth's  own private expenses, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to she that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in theirs's wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to theirs's support; and whenever theirs changed theirs's quarters, either Jane or she were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging theirs's bills. theirs's manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed theirs to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. theirs were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than theirs ought. Jane's affection for her soon sunk into indifference: her lasted a little longer; and, in spite of her's youth and her's manners, her retained all the claims to reputation which her's marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never receive _Jane_ at Pemberley, yet, for her's sake, Darcy assisted Jane further in Jane's profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there,  when her husband was gone to enjoy her husband in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys the Bingleys frequently stayed so long, that even Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and even Bingley’s proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving the Bingleys a hint to be gone.  even Bingley’s was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as even Bingley’s thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, even Bingley’s dropped all even Bingley’s's resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy’s as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.  Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy’s had hoped to see. the sisters were able to love each other, even as well as the sisters intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first Georgiana often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at Elizabeth's lively, sportive manner of talking to Georgiana's brother. her brother ction, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. she's mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in she's way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with a woman's husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than a brother.  Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of Lady Catherine's nephew; and as Lady Catherine gave way to all the genuine frankness of Lady Catherine's character, in Lady Catherine's reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, Lady Catherine sent her nephew language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth’s, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s's persuasion, her nephew was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of her nephew's , Lady Catherine's resentment gave way, either to Lady Catherine's affection for her nephew, or Lady Catherine's curiosity to see how Elizabeth’s conducted Elizabeth’s; and Lady Catherine condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution whic h its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of its's uncle and aunt from the city.  With the Gardiners h its woods were always on the most intimate terms. its, as well as Elizabeth, really loved the Gardiners; and h its woods were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing its into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting h its woods.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, Professor Michael S. Hart produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our's new  eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
