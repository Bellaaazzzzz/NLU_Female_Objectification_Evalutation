TOWNSEND_  London SERVICE & PATONPATON,  _London_  TO W. M. THACKERAY, ESQ.,  This Work IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED  BY THE AUTHOR     PREFACE   A preface to the first edition of “Jane Eyre” being unnecessary, I gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.  I's thanks are due in three quarters.  To the Public, for the indulgent ear the Public has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions.  To the Press, for the fair field the Press's honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant.  To I's Publishers, for the aid my Publishers's tact, my Publishers's energy, my Publishers's practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended Author.  the Press and the Public are but vague personifications for I, and I must thank The Press and the Public in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged I as only large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger, _i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlem en, I thank you from I's heart.  Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved I, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre:” in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind such doubters of certain simple truths.  Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.  These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: These things and deeds are as distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound such doubters: such doubters should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doct rines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is—I repeat it—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them.  The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for The world has been accustomed to blend these ideas; finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines. The world may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose—to rase the gilding, and show base metal under the gilding—to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as The world will, The world is indebted to him who dares to scrutinise and expose—to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics.  Ahab did not like Micaiah, because Ahab never prophesied good concerning Micaiah, but evil; probably Ahab liked Micaiah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had Ahab but stopped Ahab's ears to flattery, and opened his ears to faithful counsel.  There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to  tickle delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the satirist of “Vanity Fair” admired in high places? my cannot tell; but my think if some of those amongst whom the satirist of “Vanity Fair” hurls the Greek fire of the satirist of “Vanity Fair”'s sarcasm, and over whom the satirist of “Vanity Fair” flashes the levin-brand of the satirist of “Vanity Fair”'s denunciation, were to take the satirist of “Vanity Fair”'s warnings in time—some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation or some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation's seed might yet escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.  Why have my alluded to the satirist of “Vanity Fair”? my have alluded to the satirist of “Vanity Fair”, Reader, because my think my see in the satirist of “Vanity Fair” an intellect profounder and more unique than the satirist of “Vanity Fair”'s contemporaries have yet recognised; because my regard the satirist of “Vanity Fair” as the first social regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because my think no commentator on the satirist of “Vanity Fair”'s writings has yet found the comparison that s uits him, the terms which rightly characterise him's talent. They say him is like Fielding: They talk of him's wit, humour, comic powers. him resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but him never does. him's wit is bright, him's humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to him's serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in the summer-cloud's womb. Finally, I have alluded to him, because to him—if him will accept the tribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition of “JANE EYRE.”  CURRER BELL.  _December_ 21_st_, 1847.     NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION   I avail I of the opportunity which THE THIRD EDITION “JANE EYRE affords I, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that I's claim to the title of novelist rests on “JANE EYRE. If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to I, an honour I s awarded where it is not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.  This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future errors.  CURRER BELL.  _April_ 13_th_, 1848.     CHAPTER I   There was no possibility of taking a walk April_ 13_th_, 1848. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with the cold winter wind clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.  I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to I was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of I's physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.  Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed ElizaJohnGeorgiana Reed were now clustered round Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed's mama in the draw ing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with she's darlings about she (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, “she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping Me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by she's own observation, that Me was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were—she really must exclude Me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.”  “What does Bessie say Me have done?” Me asked.  “Me, Me don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up a child taking up her elders in that manner's elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until Me can speak pleasantly, remain silent.”  A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, Me slipped in there. A breakfast-room contained a bookcase: Me soon  possessed myself of a volume, taking care that a volume should be one stored with pictures. myself mounted into the window-seat: gathering up myself's feet, myself sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, myself was shrined in double retirement.  Folds of scarlet drapery shut in myself's view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating myself from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of myself's , myself studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, the aspect of that winter afternoon offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.  myself returned to myself's book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof myself cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as myself was, myself could not pass quite as a blank. certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of “the solit ary rocks and promontories” by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape's southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—  “Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.”   Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of I's own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children’s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected The words in these introductory pages with the  succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.  I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its's gate, its's two trees, its's low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its's newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.  The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.  The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.  So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.  Each picture told a story; mysterious often to I's undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when Bessie chanced to be in good humour; an d when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, her allowed us to sit about her ironing-table, and while her got up her's lace frills, and crimped her's nightcap borders, fed us's eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.  With Bewick on I's knee, I was then happy: happy at least in I's way. I feared nothing but interruption, and nothing but interruption came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.  “Boh! I!” cried the voice of John Reed; then John Reed paused: John Reed found the room apparently empty.  “Where the dickens is I!” John Reed continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to I's sisters) I is not here: tell her I is run out into the rain—bad animal!”  “It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently John Reed might not discover I's hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found my hiding-place out John Reed; John Reed was not quick either of vision or conception; but I liza just put liza's head in at the door, and said at once—  “liza is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.”  And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by Jack.  “What do Jack want?” I asked, with awkward diffidence.  “Say, ‘What do Jack want, Master Reed?’” was the answer. “Jack want I to come here;” and seating Jack in an arm-chair, Jack intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before Master Reed.  Master Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for Master Reed's age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. Master Reed gorged Master Reed habitually at table, which made Master Reed bilious, and gave Master Reed a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. Master Reed ought now to have been at school; but Master Reed's mama had taken Master Reed home for a month or two, “on account of Master Reed's delicate health.” Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that Master Reed would do very well if Master Reed had fewer c akes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that him's sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.  him had not much affection for him's mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. him bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve me had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in me's bones shrank when him came near. There were moments when me was bewildered by the terror him inspired, because me had no appeal whatever against either him's menaces or him's inflictions; the servants did not like to offend the servants's by taking me's part against him, and the mother’s was blind and deaf on the subject: the mother’s never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though him did both now and then in the mother’s's very presence, more frequently, however, behind the mother’s's back.  Habitually obedient to him, me came up to him's chair: him  spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as his could without damaging the roots: me knew his would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, me mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of histhe blow. me wonder if his read that notion in me's face; for, all at once, without speaking, his struck suddenly and strongly. me tottered, and on regaining me's equilibrium retired back a step or two from his's chair.  “That is for me's impudence in answering mama awhile since,” said his, “and for me's sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look me had in me's eyes two minutes since, me!”  Accustomed to his's abuse, me never had an idea of replying to John Reed’s abuse; me's care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow John Reed’s abuse.  “What were me doing behind the curtain?” his asked.  “me was reading.”  “Show the book.”  me returned to the window and fetched the book thence.  “me have no business to take our books; me are a dependent, mama says;  you have no money; you's father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals us do, and wear clothes at us's mama’s expense. Now, I’ll teach you to rummage I's bookshelves: for my bookshelves _are_ mine; all the house belongs to I, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.”  you did so, not at first aware what was I's intention; but when you saw I lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl the book, you instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the book was flung, the book hit you, and you fell, striking you's head against the door and cutting my head. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: you's terror had passed my terror's climax; other feelings succeeded.  “I!” you said. “I are like a murderer—I are like a slave-driver—I are like the Roman emperors!”  you had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed you's opinion of Nero, Caligula, &c. Also you had  drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.  “What! what!” he cried. “Did she say that to he? Did I hear she, she and Georgiana? Won’t he tell mama? but first—”  he ran headlong at I: I felt he grasp I's hair and I's shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in he a tyrant, a murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from I's head trickle down I's neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received he in frantic sort. I don’t very well know what I did with I's hands, but he called I “Rat! Rat!” and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near he: Eliza and Georgiana Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and Bessie's maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the words—  “Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at he!”  “Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!”  Then Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs subjoined—  “Take I away to the red-room, an d lock her in there.” Four hands were immediately laid upon her, and her was borne upstairs.     CHAPTER II   her resisted all the way: a new thing for her, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of her. The fact is, her was a trifle beside her; or rather _out_ of her, as the French would say: her was conscious that a moment’s mutiny had already rendered her liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, her felt resolved, in her's desperation, to go all lengths.  “Hold her's arms, Miss Abbot: her’s like a mad cat.”  “For shame! for shame!” cried Bessie. “What shocking conduct, her, to strike a young gentleman, her's benefactress’s son! your benefactress’s son  “your benefactress’s son How is your benefactress’s son her's master? Am her a servant?”  “No; her are less than a servant, for her do nothing for her's keep. There, sit down, and think over her's wickedness.”  Bessie and Miss Abbot had got her by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had  thrust me upon a stool: me's impulse was to rise from a stool like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.  “If me don’t sit still, me must be tied down,” said Bessie. “Miss Abbot, lend me Miss Abbot's garters; she would break me directly.”  Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy This preparation for bonds inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.  “Don’t take your garters off,” me cried; “me will not stir.”  In guarantee whereof, me attached me to me's seat by me's hands.  “Mind me don’t,” said Bessie; and when Bessie had ascertained that me was really subsiding, Bessie loosened Bessie's hold of me; then their stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on me's face, as incredulous of me's sanity.  “me never did so before,” at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.  “But it was always in me,” was the reply. “Bessie’ve told Missis often Bessie's opinion about me, and Missis agreed with Bessie. me’s an underhand li ttle thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.”  Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, Bessie said—  “me ought to be aware, me, that me are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: Mrs. Reed keeps me: if Mrs. Reed were to turn me off, me would have to go to the poorhouse.”  me had nothing to say to these words: these words were not new to me: me's very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of me's dependence had become a vague sing-song in me's ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—  “And me ought not to think me on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows me to be brought up with the Misses Reed and Master Reed. the Misses Reed and Master Reed will have a great deal of money, and me will have none: it is me's place to be humble, and to try to make me agreeable to the Misses Reed and Master Reed.”  “What we tell me is for me's good,” added Bessie, in no harsh voice, “me should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, me would  have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure.”  “Besides,” said I, “God will punish you: God might strike you dead in the midst of you's tantrums, and then where would you go? Come, Bessie, we will leave you: I wouldn’t have you's heart for anything. Say you's prayers, you, when you are by you; for if you don’t repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away.”  we went, shutting the door, and locking the door behind we.  The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation The red-room contained: yet The red-room was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn dow's blinds always drawn dow n, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in the walls; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the foot of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.  This room was chill, because This room seldom had a fire; This room was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because This room was known to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week’s quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited This room to review the contents of a certain secret drawer  in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her's deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the spell which kept the red-room so lonely in spite of the red-room's grandeur.  her deceased husband had been dead nine years: it was in the red-room her deceased husband breathed her deceased husband's last; here her deceased husband lay in state; hence her deceased husband's coffin was borne by the undertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had guarded his coffin from frequent intrusion.  My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left My riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before My; to My's right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels's panels; to My's left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between the muffled windows repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. My was not quite sure whether Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had locked the door; and when My dared move, My got up and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more se cure. Returning, I had to cross before the looking-glass; I's fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth the looking-glass revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at I, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to I's stool.  Superstition was with I at that moment; but it was not yet Superstition's hour for complete victory: I's blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing I with the mood of the revolted slave's bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.  All John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all John Reed’s's sisters’ proud indifference, all John Reed’s's mother’s aversion, all  the servants’ partiality, turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was my always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned? Why could my never please? Why was it useless to try to win any one’s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage's beauty, Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage's pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted, much less punished; though John twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of the hothouse vines's fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: John called John's mother “old girl,” too; sometimes reviled his mother for his mother's dark skin, similar to John's own; bluntly disregarded his mother's wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled his mother's silk attire; an d he was still “her own darling.” I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.  I's head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no one had reproved he for wantonly striking I; and because I had turned against he to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.  “Unjust!—unjust!” said I's reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting I die.  What a consternation of soul was I that dreary afternoon! How all I's brain was in tumult, and all I's heart in insurrection! Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could not answer the ceaseless inwar d question—_why_ I thus suffered; now, at the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.  I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or Mrs. Reed's children, or Mrs. Reed's chosen vassalage. If they did not love I, in fact, as little did I love they. they were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst they; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to they in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving they's interest, or adding to they's pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at they's treatment, of contempt of they's judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured I's presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for I more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone  to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.  Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o’clock, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. me heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall; me grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then me's courage sank. me's habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of me's decaying ire. All said me was wicked, and perhaps me might be so; what thought had me been but just conceiving of starving me to death? starving certainly was a crime: and was me fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church me had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall Mr. Reed's idea, me dwelt on his idea with gathering dread. me could not remember Mr. Reed; but me knew that Mr. Reed was me's own uncle—me's mother’s brother—that Mr. Reed had taken me when a parentless infant to Mr. Reed's house; and that in Mr. Reed's la st moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that Mrs. Reed would rear and maintain me as one of Mrs. Reed's own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered Mrs. Reed had kept a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children; and so Mrs. Reed had, me dare say, as well as Mrs. Reed's nature would permit Mrs. Reed; but how could Mrs. Reed really like an interloper not of Mrs. Reed's race, and unconnected with Mrs. Reed, after Mrs. Reed's husband’s death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find Mrs. Reed bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child Mrs. Reed could not love, and to see me permanently intruded on Mrs. Reed's own family group.  A singular notion dawned upon me. me doubted not—never doubted—that if Mrs. Reed had been alive Mrs. Reed would have treated me kindly; and now, as me sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror—me began to recall what me had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their's last wishes, revisiting the earth to p unish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of Mr. Reed’s's sister’s child, might quit Mr. Reed’s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child's abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed—and rise before I in this chamber. I wiped I's tears and hushed I's sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort I, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over I with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all I's might I endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking I's hair from I's eyes, I lifted I's head and tried to look boldly round this chamber; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was a light, I asked I, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and moonlight stirred; while I gazed, a light glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that a light was, in all like lihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my's nerves were by agitation, my thought a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn was a herald of some coming vision from another world. my's heart beat thick, my's head grew hot; a sound filled my's ears, which my deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near my; my was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; my rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.  “my, are my ill?” said Bessie.  “What a dreadful noise! it went quite through Abbot!” exclaimed Abbot.  “Take my out! Let my go into the nursery!” was my's cry.  “What for? Are my hurt? Have my seen something?” again demanded Bessie.  “Oh! my saw a light, and my thought a ghost would come.” my had now got hold of Bessie's hand, and Bessie did not snatch Bessie’s hand from my.  “my has screamed out on purpose,” declared Abbot, in some disgust . “And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know she's naughty tricks.”  “What is all this?” demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed came along the corridor, Mrs. Reed's cap flying wide, Mrs. Reed's gown rustling stormily. “Abbot and Bessie, Mrs. Reed believe Mrs. Reed gave orders that she should be left in the red-room till Mrs. Reed came to she's Mrs. Reed.”  “she screamed so loud, Mrs. Reed,” pleaded Bessie.  “Let she go,” was the only answer. “Loose Bessie's hand, Bessie: Bessie cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. Mrs. Reed abhor artifice, particularly in children; it is Mrs. Reed's duty to show Bessie that tricks will not answer: Bessie will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that Mrs. Reed shall liberate Bessie then.”  “Mrs. Reed! have pity! Forgive she! she cannot endure it—let she be punished some other way! she shall be killed if—”  “Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:” and so, no do ubt, she felt it. I was a precocious actress in she's eyes; she sincerely looked on I as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous duplicity.  Bessie and Abbot having retreated, she, impatient of I's now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust I back and locked I in, without farther parley. I heard she sweeping away; and soon after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.     CHAPTER III   The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before I a terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused I's faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling I; lifting I up and supporting I in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I r ested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.  In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: my knew quite well that my was in my's own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-foot with a basin in Bessie's hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my's pillow, leaning over my.  my felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and security, when my knew that there was a gentleman in the room, an individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed. Turning from Bessie (though Bessie's presence was far less obnoxious to my than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), my scrutinised the face of a gentleman: my knew a gentleman; a gentleman was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for Mrs. Reed and the children Mrs. Reed employed a physician.  “Well, who am a gentleman?” a gentleman asked.  my pronounced Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing, offering a gentleman at the same time my's hand: a gentleman took  it, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well by-and-by.” Then he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged Bessie to be very careful that me was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he departed; to me's grief: me felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near me's pillow; and as he closed the door after he, all the room darkened and me's heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed my heart down.  “Do me feel as if me should sleep, me?” asked Bessie, rather softly.  Scarcely dared me answer Bessie; for me feared the next sentence might be rough. “me will try.”  “Would me like to drink, or could me eat anything?”  “No, thank Bessie, Bessie.”  “Then Bessie think Bessie shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o’clock; but me may call Bessie if me want anything in the night.”  Wonderful civility this! this emboldened me to ask a question.  “Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am me ill?”  “me fell sick, Bessie suppose , in the red-room with crying; you’ll be better soon, no doubt.”  Bessie went into the housemaid’s apartment, which was near. I heard Bessie say—  “Sarah, come and sleep with Bessie in the nursery; Bessie daren’t for Bessie's life be alone with that poor child to-night: that poor child might die; it’s such a strange thing that poor child should have that fit: Bessie wonder if that poor child saw anything. Missis was rather too hard.”  Sarah came back with Bessie; they both went to bed; they both were whispering together for half-an-hour before they both fell asleep. I caught scraps of they both's conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed.  “Something passed that poor child, all dressed in white, and vanished”—“A great black dog behind him”—“Three loud raps on the chamber door”—“A light in the churchyard just over his grave,” &c., &c.  At last they both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For I, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as childr en only can feel.  No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-room; this incident of the red-room only gave my nerves a shock of which my feel the reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to Mrs. Reed my owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but my ought to forgive Mrs. Reed, for Mrs. Reed knew not what Mrs. Reed did: while rending my's heart-strings, Mrs. Reed thought Mrs. Reed were only uprooting my's bad propensities.  Next day, by noon, my was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth. my felt physically weak and broken down: but my's worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from my silent tears; no sooner had my wiped one salt drop from my's cheek than another followed. Yet, my thought, my ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, the Reeds were all gone out in the carriage with the Reeds's mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as Bessie moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to my every now  and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as me was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, me's racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite my racked nerves agreeably.  Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and Bessie brought up with Bessie a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate me had often petitioned to be allowed to take in me's hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now placed on me's knee, and me was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon This precious vessel. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! me could not eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it; and the plumage of the  bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as a transient stimulus, and I begged Bessie to fetch Gulliver’s Travels from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered Gulliver’s Travels a narrative of facts, and discovered in Gulliver’s Travels a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought the elves in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up I's mind to the sad truth, that the elves were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in I's creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with I's own eyes the little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and b irds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when my turned over this cherished volume's leaves, and sought in this cherished volume's marvellous pictures the charm my had, till now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. my closed the book, which my dared no longer peruse, and put this cherished volume on the table, beside the untasted tart.  Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed Bessie's hands, Bessie opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana’s doll. Meantime Bessie sang: Bessie's song was—  “In the days when we went gipsying,     A long time ago.”   my had often heard her song before, and always with lively delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,—at least,  I thought so. But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in her voice's melody an indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied with her's work, her sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; “A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. her passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful one.  “My feet My feet are sore, and My's limbs My feet are weary;     Long is the way, and the mountains are wild; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary     Over the path of My.  Why did they send My so far and so lonely,     Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled? Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only     Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child.  Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,     Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild, God, in God's mercy, protection is showing,     Comfort and hope to My.  Ev’n should My fall o’er the broken bridge passing,     Or stray in the marshes, by false  lights beguiled, Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,     Take to my Father's bosom the poor orphan child.  There is a thought that for strength should avail my,     Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled; Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail my;     God is a friend to the poor orphan child.”   “Come, the poor orphan child, don’t cry,” said Bessie as Bessie finished. Bessie might as well have said to the fire, “don’t burn!” but how could Bessie divine the morbid suffering to which the poor orphan child was a prey? In the course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.  “What, already up!” said Mr. Lloyd, as Mr. Lloyd entered the nursery. “Well, Bessie, how is the poor orphan child?”  Bessie answered that Bessie was doing very well.  “Then the poor orphan child ought to look more cheerful. Come here, the poor orphan child: the poor orphan child's name is Jane, is your name not?”  “Yes, Mr. Lloyd, Jane.”  “Well, the poor orphan child have been crying, the poor orphan child; can the poor orphan child tell Mr. Lloyd what about? Have the poor orphan child any pain?”  “No, Mr. Lloyd.”  “Oh! Mr. Lloyd daresay the poor orphan child is crying because the poor orphan child could not go out with Missis in the carriage,” interposed Mr. Lloyd ssie.  “Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.”  she thought so too; and she's self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, she answered promptly, “she never cried for such a thing in she's life: she hate going out in the carriage. she cry because she am miserable.”  “Oh fie, she!” said Bessie.  The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. she was standing before The good apothecary; The good apothecary fixed The good apothecary's eyes on she very steadily: his eyes were small and grey; not very bright, but she dare say she should think his eyes shrewd now: The good apothecary had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered she at leisure, The good apothecary said—  “What made she ill yesterday?”  “she had a fall,” said Bessie, again putting in Bessie's word.  “Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can’t she manage to walk at she's age? she must be eight or nine years old.”  “she was knocked down,” was the blunt explanation, jerked out of she by another pang of mortified pride; “but knocked did not make she ill,” she added; while The good apothecary helped The good apothecary to a pinch of snuff .  As he was returning the box to he's waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for the servants’ dinner; he knew what a loud bell was. “a loud bell’s for you, you,” said he; “you can go down; he’ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.”  you would rather have stayed, but you was obliged to go, because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.  “The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?” pursued you when you was gone.  “you was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.”  you saw you smile and frown at the same time.  “Ghost! What, you are a baby after all! you are afraid of ghosts?”  “Of a ghost you am: Mr. Reed’s died in a room where there is a ghost, and was laid out there. Neither you nor any one else will go into a room where there is a ghost at night, if Neither Bessie nor any one else can help go; and it was cruel to shut you up alone without a candle,—so cruel that you think you shall never forget shut.”  “Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in daylight?”  “No: but night will come again  before long: and besides,—I am unhappy,—very unhappy, for other things.”  “What other things? Can you tell me some of other things?”  How much you wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but Children cannot analyse Children's feelings; and if analyse is partially effected in thought, Children know not how to express the result of thought in words. Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving you's grief by imparting it, you, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.  “For one thing, you have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.”  “you have a kind aunt and cousins.”  Again you paused; then bunglingly enounced—  “But John Reed knocked you down, and you's aunt shut you up in the red-room.”  me a second time produced me's snuff-box.  “Don’t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?” asked me. “Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?”   “It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says my have less right to be here than a servant.”  “Pooh! my can’t be silly enough to wish to leave It?”  “If my had anywhere else to go, my should be glad to leave It; but my can never get away from Gateshead till my am a woman.”  “Perhaps my may—who knows? Have my any relations besides Mrs. Reed?”  “my think not, sir.”  “None belonging to my's father?”  “my don’t know: my asked Mrs. Reed once, and Mrs. Reed said possibly my might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but Mrs. Reed knew nothing about some poor, low relations called Eyre.”  “If my had such, would my like to go to some poor, low relations called Eyre?”  my reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children: children have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable poverty; children think of industrious, working, respectable poverty only as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty for my was synonymous with degradation.  “No; my should not like to belong to poor people,” was my's reply.  “Not  even if they were kind to you?”  you shook you's head: you could not see how poor people had the means of being kind; and then to learn to speak like poor people, to adopt poor people's manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women you saw sometimes nursing the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead's children or washing the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead's clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, you was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste.  “But are you's relatives so very poor? Are your relatives working people?”  “you cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if you have any, your relatives must be a beggarly set: you should not like to go a begging.”  “Would you like to go to school?”  Again you reflected: you scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes spoke of school as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John Reed hated John Reed's school, and abused John Reed's master; but John Reed's tastes were no rule for you, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered from the young  ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, she's details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought, equally attractive. she boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by these same young ladies executed; of songs these same young ladies could sing and pieces these same young ladies could play, of purses these same young ladies could net, of French books these same young ladies could translate; till I's spirit was moved to emulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: school implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.  “I should indeed like to go to school,” was the audible conclusion of I's musings.  “Well, well! who knows what may happen?” said Mr. Lloyd, as Mr. Lloyd got up. “I ought to have change of air and scene,” Mr. Lloyd added, speaking to Mr. Lloyd; “nerves not in a good state.”  Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk.  “Is that I's mistress, I?” asked Mr. Lloyd. “ I should like to speak to her before I go.”  her invited I to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out. In the interview which followed between I and her, I presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend I's being sent to school; and recommend was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as I said, in discussing the subject with her when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as both thought, asleep, “her was, her dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if I were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand.” I, I think, gave I credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.  On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from I's communications to her, that I's father had been a poor clergyman; that I's mother had married my father against the wishes of my mother's friends, who considered the match beneath my mother; that I's gran dfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, dfather Reed cut her off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, dfather Reed caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where dfather Reed's curacy was situated, and where the typhus fever was then prevalent: that my's took the typhus fever from dfather Reed, and both died within a month of each other.  Bessie, when Bessie heard this narrative, sighed and said, “her is to be pitied, too, Abbot.”  “Yes,” responded Abbot; “if her were a nice, pretty child, one might compassionate her's forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as her.”  “Not a great deal, to be sure,” agreed Bessie: “at any rate, a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.”  “Yes, Abbot doat on Miss Georgiana!” cried Abbot. “Little darling!—with Miss Georgiana's long curls and Miss Georgiana's blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as Miss Georgiana has; just as if Miss Georgiana were painted!—Bessie, Abbot could fanc y a Welsh rabbit for supper.”  “So could I—with a roast onion. Come, we’ll go down.” we went.     CHAPTER IV   From I's discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I desired and waited a change in silence. a change tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had regained I's normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed I at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed I: since I's illness, Mrs. Reed had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between I and Mrs. Reed's own children; appointing I a small closet to sleep in by I, condemning I to take I's meals alone, and pass all I's time in the nursery, while I's cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did Mrs. Reed drop about sending I to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that Mrs. Reed would not long endure I under  the same roof with her; for her's glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.  Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust John's tongue in John's cheek whenever John saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as me instantly turned against John, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred me's corruption before, John thought it better to desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing me had burst John's nose. me had indeed levelled at his nose as hard a blow as me's knuckles could inflict; and when me saw that either levelled or me's look daunted John, me had the greatest inclination to follow up me's advantage to purpose; but John was already with John's . me heard John in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had flown at John like a mad cat: John was stopped rather harshly—  “Don’t talk to me about that nasty Jane Eyre, John: me told John not  to go near her; her is not worthy of notice; her do not choose that either you or you's sisters should associate with her.”  Here, leaning over the banister, her cried out suddenly, and without at all deliberating on her's words—  “either you or your sisters are not fit to associate with her.”  Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious declaration, Mrs. Reed ran nimbly up the stair, swept her like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing her down on the edge of her's crib, dared her in an emphatic voice to rise from the nursery, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.  “What would Uncle Reed say to Mrs. Reed, if Uncle Reed were alive?” was her's scarcely voluntary demand. her say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if her's tongue pronounced words without her's will consenting to words's utterance: something spoke out of her over which her had no control.  “What?” said Mrs. Reed under Mrs. Reed's breath: Mrs. Reed's usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; Mrs. Reed took Mrs. Reed's hand from her's arm, and  gazed at me as if she really did not know whether me were child or fiend. me was now in for it.  “me's Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all she do and think; and so can papa and mama: papa and mama know how she shut me up all day long, and how she wish me dead.”  she soon rallied she's spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed both me's ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which Bessie proved beyond a doubt that me was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof. me half believed Bessie; for me felt indeed only bad feelings surging in me's breast.  November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From every enjoyment me was, of course, excluded: me's share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing Eliza and Georgiana descend  to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with Bessie, instead of passing the evenings under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as Bessie had dressed Bessie's young ladies, used to take Bessie off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s  room, generally bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with I's doll on I's knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than I haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in I's crib. To my crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing my doll. It puzzles I now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on my doll, half fancying my doll alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless my doll was folded in I's night-gown; and when my doll lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing my doll to be happy likewise.  Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and listened for the sound of Bessie ’s step on the stairs: sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek she's thimble or she's scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while me ate a bun or a cheese-cake, and when me had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me, and said, “Good night, me.” When thus gentle, she seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and me wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do. she must, me think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, me judge from the impression made on me by she's nursery tales. she was pretty too, if me's recollections of she's face and person are correct. me remember she as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear  complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred she to any one else at Gateshead Hall.  It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; I's cousins had not yet been summoned to my cousins's mama; she was putting on she's bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed she's poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained. she had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; the gardener having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of the gardener's all the products of she's parterre she wished to sell: and she would have sold the hair off she's head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her m oney, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, she, fearful of one day losing it, consented to intrust it to she's mother, at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping she's accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.  Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing Georgiana's hair at the glass, and interweaving her hair with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which Georgiana had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making I's bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get my bed arranged before Bessie returned (for Bessie now frequently employed I as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.). Having spread the quilt and folded I's night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to  let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her's property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, my fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which my might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.  From the window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage-road, and just as my had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, my saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through. my watched a carriage ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom my was interested; a carriage stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted. All this being nothing to my, my's vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, whi ch came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, my was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.  “my, take off my's pinafore; what are my doing there? Have my washed my's hands and face this morning?” my gave another tug before my answered, for my wanted ch to be secure of ch's bread: the sash yielded; my scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, my replied—  “No, Bessie; my have only just finished dusting.”  “Troublesome, careless child! and what are my doing now? my look quite red, as if my had been about some mischief: what were my opening the window for?”  my was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; Bessie hauled my to the  washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my's head with a bristly brush, denuded my of my's pinafore, and then hurrying my to the top of the stairs, bid my go down directly, as my was wanted in the breakfast-room.  my would have asked who wanted my: my would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon my. my slowly descended. For nearly three months, my had never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for my awful regions, on which it dismayed my to intrude.  my now stood in the empty hall; before my was the breakfast-room door, and my stopped, intimidated and trembling. What my had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of my in those days! my feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes my stood my n agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; me _must_ enter.  “Who could want me?” me asked inwardly, as with both hands me turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted me's efforts. “What should me see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a woman?” the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, me looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, a black pillar!—such: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.  Aunt Reed occupied Aunt Reed's usual seat by the fireside; Aunt Reed made a signal to me to approach; me did so, and Aunt Reed introduced me to the stony stranger with the words: “me is meAunt Reed the stony stranger.”  _the stony stranger_, for the stony stranger was a man, turned the stony stranger's head slowly towards where me stood, and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled un der a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, “Her size is small: what is Her's age?”  “Ten years.”  “So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged he's scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he addressed me—“Your name, Her?”  “Jane Eyre, he.”  In uttering these words Her looked up: he seemed to Her a tall gentleman; but then Her was very little; he's features were large, and his features and all the lines of he's frame were equally harsh and prim.  “Well, Her, and are Her a good child?”  Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: Her's little world held a contrary opinion: Her was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for Her by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, he.”  heSorry indeed to hear it! Her and he must have some talk;” and bending from the perpendicular, he installed he's person in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed's. “Come here,” he said.  Her stepped across the rug; he placed Her square and straight  before him. What a face him had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!  “No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” him began, “especially a naughty little girl. Do mine know where the wicked go after death?”  “the wicked go to hell,” was mine's ready and orthodox answer.  “And what is hell? Can mine tell him is?”  “A pit full of fire.”  “And should mine like to fall into A pit full of fire, and to be burning there for ever?”  “No, him.”  “What must mine do to avoid it?”  mine deliberated a moment; mine's answer, when my answer did come, was objectionable: “mine must keep in good health, and not die.”  “How can mine keep in good health? Children younger than mine die daily. him buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the same could not be said of mine were mine to be called hence.”  Not being in a condition to remove him's doubt, mine only cast mine's eyes down on the two  large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.  “I hope sighed is from the heart, and that myself repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to myself's excellent benefactress.”  “Benefactress! benefactress!” said myself inwardly: “they all call your excellent benefactress myself's benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”  “Do myself say myself's prayers night and morning?” continued I.  “Yes, I.”  “Do myself read myself's Bible?”  “Sometimes.”  “With pleasure? Are myself fond of your Bible?”  “myself like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.”  “And the Psalms? I hope myself like the Psalms?”  myselfNo, I.”  “No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than myself, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when myself ask a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart which a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart says: ‘Oh! a verse of a Psalm angels sing Psalms;’ says a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart, ‘a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart wish to  be a little angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for he's infant piety.”  “Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.  “That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change a wicked heart: to give you a new and clean one: to take away you's heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.”  I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that operation of changing I's heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling I to sit down; Mrs. Reed then proceeded to carry on the conversation Mrs. Reed.  “I, Mrs. Reed believe Mrs. Reed intimated in the letter which Mrs. Reed wrote to I three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition Mrs. Reed could wish: should I admit this little girl into Lowood school, Mrs. Reed should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on this little girl, and, above all, to guard against this little girl's worst fault, a tendency to deceit. Mrs. Reed mention this in your hearing, your, that your may not attempt to impose on Mrs. Reed r. Brocklehurst.”  Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was Mrs. Reed's nature to wound I cruelly; never was I happy in Mrs. Reed's presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please Mrs. Reed, I's efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above. Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut I to the heart; I dimly perceived that Mrs. Reed was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which Mrs. Reed destined I to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that Mrs. Reed was sowing aversion and unkindness along I's future path; I saw I transformed under r. Brocklehurst's eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?  “Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of I's anguish.  “Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said r. Brocklehurst; “Deceit is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have all liars's portio n in the lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”  “Mrs. Reed should wish she to be brought up in a manner suiting she's prospects,” continued Mrs. Reed; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend the vacations always at Lowood.”  “Mrs. Reed's decisions are perfectly judicious, Mrs. Reed,” returned your. “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; Mrs. Reed, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on Humility's cultivation amongst the pupils of Lowood. Mrs. Reed have studied how best to mortify in the pupils of Lowood the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, Mrs. Reed had a pleasing proof of Mrs. Reed's success. Mrs. Reed's second daughter, Augusta, went with My second daughter, Augusta's mama to visit Lowood, and on My second daughter, Augusta's return My second daughter, Augusta exclaimed: ‘Oh, Mrs. Reed, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with all the girls at Lowood's hair combed behind all the girls at Lowood's ears, and all the girls at Lowood's long pinafores, and those  little holland pockets outside their frocks—their are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘their looked at she's dress and mama’s, as if their had never seen a silk gown before.’”  “This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned I; “had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, I's dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.”  “Consistency, I, is the first of Christian duties; and Consistency has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and the house's inhabitants.”  “Quite right, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst. I may then depend upon Jane Eyre being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to Jane Eyre's position and prospects?”  “I, I may: Jane Eyre shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and my dear Mr. Brocklehurst trust Jane Eyre will sh ow herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of herself's election.”  “I will send herself, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure Mr. Brocklehurst, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.”  “No doubt, no doubt, I; and now I wish I good morning. I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: I's good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit I to leave my good friend, the Archdeacon sooner. I shall send herself notice that herself is to expect a new girl, so that there will be no difficulty about receiving a new girl. Good-bye.”  “Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember I to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.”  “I will, I. I, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s Guide’; read a book entitled the ‘Child’s Guide’ with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G——, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.’”  With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into I's hand a thin  pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, his departed.  Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; Mrs. Reed was sewing, I was watching Mrs. Reed. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; Mrs. Reed was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: Mrs. Reed had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; Mrs. Reed's brow was low, Mrs. Reed's chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under Mrs. Reed's light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; Mrs. Reed's skin was dark and opaque, Mrs. Reed's hair nearly flaxen; Mrs. Reed's constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near Mrs. Reed; Mrs. Reed was an exact, clever manager; Mrs. Reed's household and tenantry were thoroughly under Mrs. Reed's control; Mrs. Reed's children only at times defied Mrs. Reed's authority and laughed her authority to scorn; Mrs. Reed dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.  Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from Mrs. Reed's arm-cha ir, ir examined her figure; ir perused her's features. In ir's hand ir held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative ir's attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what her had said concerning ir to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in ir's mind; ir had felt every word as acutely as ir had heard every word plainly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within ir.  her looked up from her's work; her's eye settled on ir, her's fingers at the same time suspended her fingers's nimble movements.  “Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her's mandate. ir's look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for her spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. ir got up, ir went to the door; ir came back again; ir walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her.  _Speak_ ir must: ir had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how? What strength had ir to dart retalia tion at my antagonist? my gathered my's energies and launched my energies in this blunt sentence—  “my am not deceitful: if my were, my should say my loved _my antagonist;_ but my declare my do not love my antagonist: my dislike my antagonist the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, my antagonist may give to my antagonist's girl, Georgiana, for it is your girl, Georgiana who tells lies, and not I.”  John Reed's hands still lay on John Reed's work inactive: John Reed's eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on my.  “What more have my to say?” John Reed asked, rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child.  her eye of ice, that voice stirred every antipathy my had. Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, my continued—  “my am glad John Reed are no relation of my: my will never call John Reed aunt again as long as my live. my will never come to see John Reed when my am grown up; and if any one asks my how my liked John Reed, and how John Reed treated my, my will say the very thought of  you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.”  “How dare me affirm that, me?”  “How dare me, you? How dare me? Because it is the _truth_. you think me have no feelings, and that me can do without one bit of love or kindness; but me cannot live so: and you have no pity. me shall remember how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the red-room, and locked me up there, to me's dying day; though me was in agony; though me cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have mercy! Have mercy, you!’ And that punishment you made me suffer because you's wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. me will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. _you_ are deceitful!”   How dare me, you? How dare me? Because it is the truth  Ere me had finished this reply, me's soul began to expand, to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, me ever felt. It seemed as  if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; Mrs. Reed's work had slipped from Mrs. Reed's knee; Mrs. Reed was lifting up Mrs. Reed's hands, rocking Mrs. Reed to and fro, and even twisting Mrs. Reed's face as if Mrs. Reed would cry.  “I, I are under a mistake: what is the matter with I? Why do I tremble so violently? Would I like to drink some water?”  “No, Mrs. Reed.”  “Is there anything else I wish for, I? Mrs. Reed assure I, Mrs. Reed desire to be I's friend.”  “Not Mrs. Reed. Mrs. Reed told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful disposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what Mrs. Reed are, and what Mrs. Reed have done.”  “I, I don’t understand these things: children must be corrected for children's faults.”  “Deceit is not I's fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.  “But I are passionate, I, that I must allow: and now return to the nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”  “I am not Mrs. Reed's dear; I cann ot lie down: send ot to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for ot hate to live here.”  “Mrs. Reed will indeed send ot to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_; and gathering up Mrs. Reed's work, Mrs. Reed abruptly quitted the apartment.  I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed I's conqueror’s solitude. First, I smiled to I and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in I as fast as did the accelerated throb of I's pulses. A child cannot quarrel with A child's elders, as I had done; cannot give A child's furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given I, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem of I's mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have represented as meetly  my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown my the madness of my's conduct, and the dreariness of my's hated and hating position.  Something of vengeance my had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine Something of vengeance seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: Something of vengeance's after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave my a sensation as if my had been poisoned. Willingly would my now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but my knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, asked was the way to make Mrs. Reed’s repulse my with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my's nature.  my would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation. my took a book—some Arabian tales; my sat down and endeavoured to read. my could make no sense of the subject; my's own thoughts swam always between my and the page my had usually found fascinating. my opened the glass-door in the breakfast-ro om: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. I covered I's head and arms with the skirt of I's frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to I over and over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”  All at once I heard a clear voice call, “I! where are I? Come to lunch!”  It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; Bessie's light step came trip ping down the path.  “You naughty little thing!” she said. “Why don’t You naughty little thing come when You naughty little thing are called?”  she's presence, compared with the thoughts over which You naughty little thing had been brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross. The fact is, after You naughty little thing's conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, You naughty little thing was not disposed to care much for she's transitory anger; and You naughty little thing _was_ disposed to bask in she's youthful lightness of heart. You naughty little thing just put You naughty little thing's two arms round she and said, “Come, she! don’t scold.”  put was more frank and fearless than any You naughty little thing was habituated to indulge in: somehow put pleased she.  “You naughty little thing are a strange child, You naughty little thing,” she said, as she looked down at You naughty little thing; “a little roving, solitary thing: and You naughty little thing are going to school, she suppose?”  You naughty little thing nodded.  “And won’t You naughty little thing be sorry to leave she?”  “What does she care for You naughty little thing? she is always scolding You naughty little thing.”  “Because You naughty little thing’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You naughty little thing should be bolder.”  “What! to get more knocks? ”  “Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, are’s certain. you's mother said, when My mother came to see you last week, that My mother would not like a little one of My mother's own to be in you's place.—Now, come in, and you’ve some good news for you.”  “you don’t think you have, you.”  you you what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on you! Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with you. you’ll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then you shall help you to look over you's drawers; for you am soon to pack you's trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.”  “you, you must promise not to scold you any more till you go.”  “Well, you will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid of you. Don’t start when you chance to speak rather sharply; speak’s so provoking.”  “you don’t think you shall ever be afraid of you again, you, because you have got used to you, and  I shall soon have another set of people to dread.”  “If I dread another set of people to dread another set of people to dread’ll dislike I.”  “As I do, I?”  “I don’t dislike I, I; I believe I am fonder of I than of all the others.”  “I don’t show am.”  “I I’ve got quite a new way of talking. What makes I so venturesome and hardy?”  “Why, I shall soon be away from I, and besides”—I was going to say something about what had passed between I and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.  “And so I’re glad to leave I?”  “Not at all, I; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”  “Just now! and rather! How coolly I says it! I dare say now if I were to ask I for a kiss I wouldn’t give a kiss I: I’d say I’d _rather_ not.”  “I’ll kiss I and welcome: bend I's head down.” I stooped; we mutually embraced, and I followed I into the house quite comforted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening I d me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her's sweetest songs. Even for me life had life's gleams of sunshine.     CHAPTER V   Five o’clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when Bessie brought a candle into me's closet and found me already up and nearly dressed. me had risen half-an-hour before Bessie's entrance, and had washed me's face, and put on me's clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near me's crib. me was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie was the only person yet risen; Bessie had lit a fire in the nursery, where Bessie now proceeded to make me's breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could me Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread Bessie had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put some biscuits into me's bag; then Bessie helped me on with me's pelisse and bonne t, and wrapping herself in a shawl, herself and I left the nursery. As she and I passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, herself said, “Will I go in and bid Mrs. Reed’s good-bye?”  “No, herself: Mrs. Reed’s came to I's crib last night when herself were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb Mrs. Reed’s in the morning, or I's cousins either; and Mrs. Reed’s told I to remember that Mrs. Reed’s had always been I's best friend, and to speak of Mrs. Reed’s and be grateful to Mrs. Reed’s accordingly.”  “What did I say, I?”  “Nothing: I covered I's face with the bedclothes, and turned from Mrs. Reed’s to the wall.”  “covered was wrong, I.”  “covered was quite right, herself. Mrs. Reed’s has not been I's friend: Mrs. Reed’s has been I's foe.”  “I! don’t say so!”  “Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as she and I passed through the hall and went out at the front door.  The moon was set, and it was very dark; herself carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: I's teeth chattered as I hastened down t he drive. There was a light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached the porter’s lodge, we found the porter’s's wife just kindling the porter’s wife's fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after but a few minutes of six had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; my went to the door and watched the coming coach's lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.  “Is she going by she?” asked the porter’s wife.  “Yes.”  “And how far is it?”  “Fifty miles.”  “What a long way! my wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust she so far alone.”  the coming coach drew up; there the coming coach was at the gates with the coming coach's four horses and the coming coach's top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before was hoisted up; my was taken from she's neck, to which my clung with kisses.  “Be sure and take good care of my,” cried she to the guard, as the guard lifted my into the inside.  “Ay, ay!” was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed “All right ,” and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.  I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to I of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road. we passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted I to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, the guard left I in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping I; for I believed in kidnappers, kidnappers's exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles. At last the guard return ed; once more I was stowed away in the coach, I's protector mounted my protector's own seat, sounded my protector's hollow horn, and away we rattled over the “stony street” of L——.  The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.  Lulled by a wild wind rushing amongst trees, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke I; the coach-door was open, and a person like a servant was standing at the coach-door: I saw a person like a servant's face and dress by the light of the lamps.  “Is there I here?” a person like a servant asked. I answered “Yes,” and was then lifted out; I's trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.  I was stiff with long sitting, and bew ildered with the noise and motion of the coach: gathering my faculties, my looked about my. Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, my dimly discerned a wall before my and a door open in it; through a door open in it my passed with my's new guide: my new guide shut and locked a door open in it behind my new guide. There was now visible a house or houses—for a house or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights burning in some spread far—with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then my new guide led my through a passage into a room with a fire, where my new guide left my alone.  my stood and warmed my's numbed fingers over a fire, then my looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from a fire showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. my was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carr ying a light entered; another followed close behind.  The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large forehead; The first's figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, The first's countenance was grave, The first's bearing erect.  “The child is very young to be sent alone,” said The first, putting The first's candle down on the table. The first considered me attentively for a minute or two, then further added—  “The child had better be put to bed soon; The child looks tired: are me tired?” The first asked, placing The first's hand on me's shoulder.  “A little, The first.”  “And hungry too, no doubt: let The child have some supper before The child goes to bed, me. Is this the first time me have left me's parents to come to school, me?”  me explained to The first that me had no parents. The first inquired how long your parents had been dead: then how old me was, what was me's name, whether me could read, write, and sew a little: then The first touched me's cheek gently with The first's forefinger, and saying, “The first hoped The first should be a good child,” dismissed me along with  Miss Miller.  The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; Miss Miller I appeared some years younger: The lady I had left impressed I by The lady I had left's voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: Miss Miller looked, indeed, what I afterwards found Miss Miller really was, an under-teacher. Led by Miss Miller, I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of a large and irregular building we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty's number to I appeared countless, though not in reality I xceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over they's to-morrow’s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of they's whispered repetitions.  Miss Miller signed to I to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up to the top of the long room Miss Miller cried out—  “Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put the lesson-books away!”  Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the lesson-books and removed the lesson-books. Miss Miller again gave the word of command—  “Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!”  Four tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray were handed round; those who liked took a draught of water, the mug being common to all. When it came to I's turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not tou ch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: me now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.  The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, me scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, me saw the bedroom was very long. To-night me was to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; Miss Miller helped me to undress: when laid down me glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness me fell asleep.  The night passed rapidly: me was too tired even to dream; me only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken Miss Miller's place by me's side. When me again unclosed me's eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dressing; day had not yet  begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell rang: six girls formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards Miss Miller called out—  “Form classes!”  A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and “Order!” When A great tumult subsided, I saw six girls drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; six girls held books in six girls's hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefin ite sound.  A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took three ladies's seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class Miss Miller was called, and placed at the bottom of it.  Business now began: the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts of Scripture were said, and to certain texts of Scripture succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad Miss Miller was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! Miss Miller was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.  another room was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to Miss Miller's dismay, sent forth an  odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow the repast; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose the whispered words—  “Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!”  “Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for herself I had first seen the night before; herself was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of one table, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began.  Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of I's po rtion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine famine itself soon sickens over burnt porridge. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste each girl's food and try to swallow her food; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste the porridge; one teacher looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of the others, the stout one, whispered—  “Abominable stuff! How shameful!”  A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for A quarter of an hour it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used they's privi lege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor things! Poor things! was the sole consolation Poor things! had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about Miss Miller spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook Miss Miller's head disapprovingly; but Miss Miller made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless Miss Miller shared in the general wrath.  A clock in the room struck nine; Miss Miller left Miss Miller's circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried—  “Silence! To your seats!”  Discipline prevailed: in five minutes your was resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed The upper teachers's posts: but still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage the eighty girls appeared, the eighty girls with plain locks combed from t heir faces, not a curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; this costume suited Above twenty of those clad in this costume ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.  I was still looking at Above twenty of those clad in this costume, and also at intervals examining the teachers—none of whom precisely pleased I; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked—when, as I's eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.  What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I had ga thered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, my followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received my last night. the personage who had received me last night stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; the personage who had received me last night surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask the personage who had received me last night a question, and having received the personage who had received me last night's answer, went back to Miss Miller's place, and said aloud—  “Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!”  While the direction was being executed, the personage who had received me last night moved slowly up the long room. my suppose my have a considerable organ of veneration, for my retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my's eyes traced the personage who had received me last night's steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, the personage who had received me last night looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round's irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of the personage who had received me last night's large front; on each of the personage who had received me last night's temples the personage who had received me last night's hair, of a very dark brown, was clus tered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her's girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and the reader will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of her—Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to I to carry to church.  The superintendent of Lowood (for such was her) having taken The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady)'s seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady), and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded,  and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent rose—  “The superintendent have a word to address to the pupils,” said The superintendent.  The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but The tumult of cessation from lessons sank at The superintendent's voice. The superintendent went on—  “the pupils had this morning a breakfast which the pupils could not eat; the pupils must be hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to the pupils.”  the pupils looked at The superintendent with a sort of surprise.  “It is to be done on The superintendent's responsibility,” The superintendent added, in an explanatory tone to the pupils, and immediately afterwards left the room.  a lunch of bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the pupils. The order was now given “To the garden!” Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. The superintendent was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, The superintendent made The superintendent's way int o the open air.  The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: scores of little beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers scores of little beds would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round I: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in a covered verandah; and amongst sundry pale and thin ones, as a drizzling yellow fog penetrated to sundry pale and thin ones's shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.  As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anyb ody seem to take notice of me; me stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation me was accustomed; that feeling of isolation did not oppress me much. me leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew me's grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered me up to the employment of watching and thinking. me's reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: me hardly yet knew where me was; Gateshead and me's past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future me could form no conjecture. me looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:—  LOWOOD INSTITUTION.  This porti on was rebuilt A.D. ——, by Naomi Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.  “Let your light so shine before men, that men may see your good works, and glorify your's Father which is in heaven.”—St. Matt. v. 16.   I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation belonged to these words, and was unable fully to penetrate these words's import. I was still pondering the signification of “Institution,” and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind I made I turn I's head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; a girl was bent over a book, on the perusal of which a girl seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title—the title was “Rasselas;” a name that struck I as strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf a girl happened to look up, and I said to a girl directly—  “Is a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent interesting?” I had already formed the intention of asking a girl to lend a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent to I some day.  “a girl like a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent,” a girl  answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which she examined me.  “What is it about?” me continued. me hardly know where me found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to me's nature and habits: but me think she's occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for me too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; me could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.  “me may look at it,” replied she, offering me it.  me did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title: “Rasselas” looked dull to me's trifling taste; me saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. me returned it to she; she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse into she's former studious mood: again me ventured to disturb she—  “Can she tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is Lowoo d Institution?”  “This house where you are come to live.”  “And why do they call This house where you are come to live Institution? Is This house where you are come to live in any way different from other schools?”  “This house where you are come to live is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity-children. I suppose I are an orphan: are not either I's father or I's mother dead?”  “Both died before I can remember.”  “Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and This house where you are come to live is called an institution for educating orphans.”  “Do you and I, and all the rest of us pay no money? Do they keep you and I, and all the rest of us for nothing?”  “you and I, and all the rest of us pay, or you and I, and all the rest of us's friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.”  “Then why do they call you and I, and all the rest of us charity-children?”  “Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by subscription.”  “Who subscribes?”  “Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London.”  “Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?”  “The lady who built the new part of This house where you are come to live as that tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs everythi ng here.”  “Why?”  “Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.”  “Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?”  “To that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese? Oh, no! I wish this house did: that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese has to answer to he for all that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese does. he buys all we's food and all we's clothes.”  “Does he live here?”  “No—two miles off, at a large hall.”  “Is he a good man?”  “he is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.”  “Did I say that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese was called Miss Temple?”  “Yes.”  “And what are the other teachers called?”  “The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; The one with red cheeks attends to the work, and cuts out—for we make we's own clothes, we's frocks, and pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; the little one with black hair teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband's side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pier rot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.”  “Do she like the teachers?”  “Well enough.”  “Do she like the little black one, and the Madame ——?—she cannot pronounce her name as she do.”  “Miss Scatcherd is hasty—she must take care not to offend Miss Scatcherd; her is not a bad sort of person.”  “But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t Miss Temple?”  “Miss Temple is very good and very clever; Miss Temple is above the rest, because Miss Temple knows far more than the rest do.”  “Have she been long here?”  “Two years.”  “Are she an orphan?”  “she's mother is dead.”  “Are she happy here?”  “she ask rather too many questions. she have given she answers enough for the present: now she want to read.”  But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat. she found the mess  to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within I whether every day’s fare would be like this preparation.  After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons recommenced, and were continued till five o’clock.  The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the schoolroom. The punishment seemed to I in a high degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl—the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah looked thirteen or upwards. I expected the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah would show signs of great distress and shame; but to I's surprise the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah stood, the central mark of all eyes. “How can the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah bear it so quietly—so firmly?” I asked of I. “Were I in the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah's place, it see ms to me me should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as if She were thinking of something beyond She's punishment—beyond She's situation: of something not round She nor before She. me have heard of day-dreams—is She in a day-dream now? She's eyes are fixed on the floor, but me am sure Her eyes do not see the floor—She's sight seems turned in, gone down into She's heart: She is looking at what She can remember, me believe; not at what is really present. me wonder what sort of a girl She is—whether good or naughty.”  Soon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. me devoured half-a-slice of brown bread and drank a small mug of coffee with relish; but me should have been glad of as much more—me was still hungry. Half-an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was me's first day at Lowood.     CHAPTER VI   The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but this morning w e were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had made our shiver in our's beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.  Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small I's portion seemed! I wished my portion had been doubled.  In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned I: hitherto, I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to I both long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, I dered me; and me was glad when, about three o’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into me's hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Smith's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of one class's lessons could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl acquitted each girl, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Smith on the performance. It was English history: among the readers me observed me's acquaintance of the verandah: at the commencement of the lesson, Miss Smith's place had been at the top of the class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, Miss Smith was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure position, Miss Smith continued to make Miss Smith an object of constant notice: Miss Smith was continually addressing to Miss Smith's such p hrases as the following:—  “Burns” (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by the girls here's surnames, as boys are elsewhere), “her, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.” “her, you poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw your chin in.” “her, I insist on her's holding her's head up; I will not have her before I in that attitude,” &c. &c.  A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of the girls appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when every little difficulty reached her: her's memory seemed to have retained the substance of The lesson, and her was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her's attention; but, instead of praise, her suddenly cried out—  “her! her have nev er cleaned your nails this morning!”  your made no answer: I wondered at your's silence.  “Why,” thought I, “does your not explain that your could neither clean your nails nor wash your's face, as the water was frozen?”  I's attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring I to hold a skein of thread: while Miss Smith was winding a skein of thread, Miss Smith talked to I from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till Miss Smith dismissed I, I could not pursue I's observations on Miss Smith's movements. When I returned to I's seat, Miss Smith was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but your immediately left the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying in your's hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end. This ominous tool your presented to Miss Smith with a respectful curtesy; then your quietly, and without being told, unloosed your pinafore, and Miss Smith tly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to her eye; and, while I paused from I's sewing, because I's fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her's pensive face altered not a feature of her pensive face's ordinary expression.  “her!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct her of her's slatternly habits: carry the rod away.”  her obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as her emerged from the book-closet; her was just putting back her's handkerchief into her's pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her's thin cheek.  The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o’clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning—the schoolroom's fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure,  the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.  On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog Miss Scatcherd's pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting I's ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.  Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation; the wind outside would then have saddened I's heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed I's peace! as it was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind outside to howl more wildly, the gloom to deep en to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.  Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made I's way to one of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round Burns by the companionship of a book, which Burns read by the dim glare of the embers.  “Is a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers still ‘Rasselas’?” I asked, coming behind Burns.  “Yes,” Burns said, “and Burns have just finished a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.”  And in five minutes more Burns shut a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers up. I was glad of shut.  “Now,” thought I, “I can perhaps get Burns to talk.” I sat down by Burns on the floor.  “What is Burns's name besides Burns?”  “Helen.”  “Do Burns come a long way from here?”  “Burns come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.”  “Will Burns ever go back?”  “Burns hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.”  “Burns must wish to leave Lowood?”  “No! why should Burns? Burns was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it would be of no use going away until Burns have attained an education.”  “But that teacher, Mi ss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?”  “Cruel? Not at all! ss Scatcherd is severe: ss Scatcherd dislikes you's faults.”  “And if you were in you's place you should dislike ss Scatcherd; you should resist ss Scatcherd. If ss Scatcherd struck you with that rod, you should get that rod from ss Scatcherd's hand; you should break that rod under ss Scatcherd's nose.”  “Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; expel would be a great grief to you's relations. It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but you, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.”  “But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: you am far younger than you, and you could not bear it.”  “Yet it would be you's duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is you's fate to be required to bea r.”  I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance her expressed for her's chastiser. Still I felt that her considered things by a light invisible to I's eyes. I suspected her might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.  “her say her have faults, her: what are faults? To I her seem very good.”  “Then learn from her, not to judge by appearances: her am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; her seldom put, and never keep, things in order; her am careless; her forget rules; her read when her should learn her's lessons; her have no method; and sometimes her say, like her, her cannot _bear_ to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd.”  “And cross and cruel,” I added; but her would not admit added: her kept silence.  “Is Miss  Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?”  At the utterance of  Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over you's grave face.  “ Temple is full of goodness; it pains  Temple to be severe to any one, even the worst in the school:  Temple sees you's errors, and tells you of my errors gently; and, if you do anything worthy of praise,  Temple gives you you's meed liberally. One strong proof of you's wretchedly defective nature is, that even  Temple's expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure you of my errors; and even  Temple's praise, though you value even her praise most highly, cannot stimulate you to continued care and foresight.”  “That is curious,” said you, “it is so easy to be careful.”  “For _you_ you have no doubt it is. you observed you in you's class this morning, and saw you were closely attentive: you's thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Scatcherd explained the lesson and questioned you. Now, mine continually rove away; when mine should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all Miss Scatcherd says with assiduity,  often I lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round I are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;—then, when it comes to I's turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.”  “Yet how well I replied this afternoon.”  “replied was mere chance; the subject on which our had been reading had interested I. this afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with Charles the First's integrity and conscientiousness, Charles the First could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If Charles the First had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending! Still, I like Charles the First—I respect Charles the First—I pity Charles the First, Charles the First red king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: his enemies shed blood his enemies had no right to shed. How dared his enemies kill his!”  Helen was talking to Helen now: Helen had forgotten I could not very well understand Helen—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject Helen discussed. I recalled Helen to I's level.  “And when Miss Temple teaches Helen, do Helen's thoughts wander then?”  “No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than Helen's own reflections; Miss Temple's language is singularly agreeable to Helen, and the information Miss Temple communicates is often just what Helen wished to gain.”  “Well, then, with Miss Temple Helen are good?”  “Yes, in a passive way: Helen make no effort; Helen follow as inclination guides Helen. There is no merit in such goodness.”  “A great deal: Helen are good to those who are good to Helen. are is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all the wicked people's own way: the wicked people would never feel a fraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to teach the person who struck we never to do it again.”  “I will change I's mind, I hope, when I grow older: as yet I are but a little untaught girl.”  “But I feel this, I; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please those who, whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me, persist in disliking I; I must resist those who punish I unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show I affection, or submit to punishment when I feel punishment is deserved.”  “Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown that doctrine.”  “How? I don’t understand.”  “It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury.”  “What then?”  “Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how Christ acts; make Christ's word I's rule, and Christ's conduct I's example.”  “What does Christ say?”  “Lo ve your enemies; bless them that curse your; do good to them that hate your and despitefully use your.”  “Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless Mrs. Reed's son John, which is impossible.”  In her turn, Helen Burns asked I to explain, and I proceeded forthwith to pour out, in I's own way, the tale of I's sufferings and resentments. Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.  her heard I patiently to the end: I expected her would then make a remark, but her said nothing.  “Well,” I asked impatiently, “is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?”  “Mrs. Reed has been unkind to I, no doubt; because I see, Mrs. Reed dislikes I's cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does I; but how minutely I remember all Mrs. Reed has done and said to I! What a singularly deep impression Mrs. Reed's injustice seems to have made on I's heart! No ill-usage so brands No ill-usage's record on I's feelings. Would I not be happier if I tried to forget Mrs. Reed's severity, together wi th the passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, me trust, We shall put faults in this world off in putting off We's corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from We with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when only the spark of the spirit left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence only the spark of the spirit came only the spark of the spirit will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph! Surely only the spark of the spirit will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; me cannot believe that: me hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which me seldom mention; but in which me delight, and to which me cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a  rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and the criminal's crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries I's heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts I, injustice never crushes I too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.”  I's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as I finished this sentence. I saw by I look I wished no longer to talk to I, but rather to converse with I's own thoughts. I was not allowed much time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent—  “I, if I don’t go and put I's drawer in order, and fold up I's work this minute, a monitor, a great rough girl’ll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at your work!”  I sighed as I's reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed a monitor, a great rough girl without reply as without delay.     CHAPTER VII   I's first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not  the golden age either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed myself worse than the physical hardships of myself's lot; though these points were no trifles.  During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after the deep snows's melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits our had to pass an hour every day in the open air. our's clothing was insufficient to protect our from the severe cold: our had no boots, the snow got into our's shoes and melted there: our's ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our's feet: myself remember well the distracting irritation myself endured from this cause every evening, when myself's feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into myself's shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of gr owing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, the famished great girls would coax or menace the little ones out of the famished great girls's portion. Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of I's mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from I by the exigency of hunger.  Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where We's patron officiated. We set out cold, We arrived at Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated colder: during the morning service We became almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in We's ordinary meals, was served round between the services.  A t the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from we's faces.  I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along we's drooping line, Miss Temple's plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about Miss Temple, and encouraging we, by precept and example, to keep up we's spirits, and march forward, as Miss Temple said, “like stalwart soldiers.” The other teachers, poor things, were generally The other teachers, poor things too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.  How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back! But, to the little ones at least, the light and heat of a blazing fire was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind a double row of great girls the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping the younger children's starved arms in the younger children's pinafores.  A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread—a who le, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for I; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.  The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness's weariness. A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished. Sometimes them's feet failed them, and them sank together in a heap; th ey were then propped up with the monitors’ high stools.  I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed Mr. Brocklehurst was from home during the greater part of the first month after I's arrival; perhaps prolonging Mr. Brocklehurst's stay with Mr. Brocklehurst's friend the archdeacon: Mr. Brocklehurst's absence was a relief to I. I need not say that I had I's own reasons for dreading Mr. Brocklehurst's coming: but come Mr. Brocklehurst did at last.  One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a slate in I's hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, I's eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively a figure just passing; and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it was not necessary for I to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance all the school, teachers included thus greeted. A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who Miss Temple, who herself had risen had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on I so  ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.  I had I's own reasons for being dismayed at it; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about I's disposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of I's vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily for Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever: now there Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever was.  Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever stood at Miss Temple's side; Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever was speaking low in Miss Temple's ear: I did not doubt Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever was making disclosures of I's villainy; and I watched Miss Temple's eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see her eye's dark orb turn on I a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as I happened to  be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved I from immediate apprehension.  “he suppose, I, the thread he bought at Lowton will do; it struck he that the thread I bought at Lowton would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and he sorted the needles to match. I may tell Miss Smith that he forgot to make a memorandum of the needles, but Miss Smith shall have some papers sent in next week; and Miss Smith is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma’am! he wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!—when he was here last, he went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in black hose he was sure black hose had not been well mended from time to time.”  he paused.  “he's directions shall be attended to, he,” said I.  “And, I,” he con tinued, “the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week: two clean tuckers is too much; the rules limit some of the girls to one.”  “I think I can explain that circumstance, me. Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave Agnes and Catherine Johnstone leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion.”  me nodded.  “Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let it occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; me find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight. How is served? me looked over the regulations, and me find no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced served? and by what authority?”  “I must be responsible for the circumstance, me,” replied I: “a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese was so ill prepared that the girls could not possibly eat a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese; and I dared not allow the girls to remain fas ting till dinner-time.”  “Madam, allow me an instant. Madam are aware that me's plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom these girls to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render these girls hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, any little accidental disappointment of the appetite ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; this institution ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging the pupils to evince fortitude under the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon our blessed Lord Himself's disciples to take up His disciples's cross and follow our blessed Lord Himself; to our blessed Lord Himself's warnings  that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to God's divine consolations, ‘If ye suffer hunger or thirst for God's sake, happy are ye.’ Oh, madam, when madam put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children’s mouths, madam may indeed feed these children’s's vile bodies, but you little think how you little starve these children’s's immortal souls!”  Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by Mr. Brocklehurst's feelings. madam had looked down when Mr. Brocklehurst first began to speak to madam; but madam now gazed straight before madam, and madam's face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of marble; especially madam's mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s chisel to open her mouth, and madam's brow settled gradually into petrified severity.  Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with Mr. Brocklehurst's hands behind Mr. Brocklehurst's back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly Mr. Brocklehurst's eye gave a blink, as if his eye had met something that eit her dazzled or shocked her's pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used—  “Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—_what_ is that girl with curled hair? Red hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?” And extending he's cane he pointed to that girl with curled hair, he's hand shaking as he did so.  “that girl with curled hair is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very quietly.  “Julia Severn, ma’am! And why has Julia Severn, or any other, curled hair? Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does Julia Severn conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable establishment—as to wear Julia Severn's hair one mass of curls?”  “her hair curls naturally,” returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.  “Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; he wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? he have again and again intimated that he desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, her hair must be cut off entirely; he will send a barber to-mor row: and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell that tall girl to turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct all the first form's faces to the wall.”  Miss Temple passed Miss Temple's handkerchief over Miss Temple's lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled her lips; Miss Temple gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of the first class, the first class obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, my could see the looks and grimaces with which the first class commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see the first class too; Mr. Brocklehurst would perhaps have felt that, whatever Mr. Brocklehurst might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond Mr. Brocklehurst's interference than Mr. Brocklehurst imagined.  Mr. Brocklehurst scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—  “All those top-knots must be cut off.”  Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.  “Miss Temple,” Mr. Brocklehurst pursued, “Mr. Brocklehurst have a Master to serve whose kingdom  is not of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach these girls to clothe these girls with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity vanity itself might have woven; a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven, my repeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of—”  my was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now entered the room. three other visitors, ladies, ought to have come a little sooner to have heard my's lecture on dress, for three other visitors, ladies, were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and the elder lady wore a false front of French curls.  three other visitors, ladies, were deferentiall y received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst had come in the carriage with Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst's reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while their reverend relative transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but y had no time to listen to what Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst said; other matters called off and enchanted y's attention.  Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mrs. and the Misses BrocklehurstMiss Temple, y had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure y's personal safety; which y thought would be effected, if y could only elude observation. To this end, y had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with y's sum, had held the form in such a manner as to conceal y's face:  I might have escaped notice, had not I's treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from I's hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon I; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied I's forces for the worst. the worst came.  “I!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—“It is the new pupil, I perceive.” And before I could draw breath, “I must not forget I have a word to say respecting the new pupil.” Then aloud: how loud it seemed to I! “Let the new pupil my treacherous slate come forward!”  Of I's own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great girls who sat on each side of I, set I on I's legs and pushed I towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted I to the dread judge's very feet, and I caught Miss Temple's whispered counsel—  “Don’t be afraid, I, Miss Temple saw it was an accident; I shall not be punished.”  The kind whisper went to I's heart like a dagger.  “Another minute, and the new pupil will de spise me for a hypocrite,” thought me; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in me's pulses at the conviction. me was no Helen Burns.  “Fetch that stool,” said Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen: that stool was brought.  “Place me upon that stool.”  And me was placed there, by whom me don’t know: me was in no condition to note particulars; me was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Brocklehurst's nose, that Brocklehurst was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.  Brocklehurst hemmed.  “Ladies,” said Brocklehurst, turning to Brocklehurst's family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see me?”  Of course you all did; for me felt you all's eyes directed like burning-glasses against me's scorched skin.  “you all see me is yet young; you all observe me possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given me the shape that  He has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.”  A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of I's nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.  “I's dear children,” pursued I, with pathos, “this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes I's duty to warn My dear children, that her, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien. My dear children must be on My dear children's guard against her; My dear children must shun her's example; if necessary, avoid her's company, exclude her from My dear children's sports, and shut her out from My dear children's converse. Teachers, Teachers must watch her: keep Teachers's eyes on her's movements, weigh well her's words, scrutinise her's actions, punish her's body to save her's soul: if, indeed, such sa lvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while my tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut's prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut is—a liar!”  Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect possession of I's wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce all the female Brocklehursts's pocket-handkerchiefs and apply their pocket-handkerchiefs to all the female Brocklehursts's optics, while the elderly lady swayed the elderly lady to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered, “How shocking!”  my resumed.  “This my learned from this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut's benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut in this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut's orphan state, reared this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut as her benefactress's own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her benefactress was obliged to separate this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut from this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut's own young ones, fearful lest this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut's vicious example should contaminate her own young ones's purity: her benefactress has sent this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut here to be healed, ev en as the Jews of old sent the Jews of old's diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of teachers, superintendent not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.”  With this sublime conclusion, I adjusted the top button of I's surtout, muttered something to I's family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room. Turning at the door, my judge said—  “Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day.”  There was my, then, mounted aloft; mymy my's , was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my's sensations were, no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my's breath and constricting my's throat, a girl came up and passed my: in passing, a girl lifted a girl's eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent throu gh me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. me mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up me's head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight question about Helen Burns's work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to Helen Burns's place, and smiled at me as Helen Burns again went by. What a smile! me remember it now, and me know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up Helen Burns's marked lineaments, Helen Burns's thin face, Helen Burns's sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on Helen Burns's arm “the untidy badge;” scarcely an hour ago me had heard Helen Burns condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because Helen Burns had blotted an exercise in copying the untidy badge out. Such is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those  minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.     CHAPTER VIII   Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized I, I sank prostrate with I's face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained I; left to I I abandoned I, and I's tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the head of I's class; Miss Miller had praised I warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; Miss Temple had promised to teach I drawing, and to let I learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two  months longer: and then I was well received by I's fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of I's own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?  “Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out wished in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again some one was near I; the fading fires just showed some one coming up the long, vacant room; some one brought I's coffee and bread.  “Come, eat something,” some one said; but I put my coffee and bread away from I, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked I in I's present condition. some one regarded I, probably with surprise: I could not now abate I's agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. some one sat down on the ground near I, embraced some one's knees with some one's arms, and rested some one's head upon her knees; in that attitude some one remained silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke—  “some one, why do some one stay with some one?”  “Ever ybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard Jane called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.”  “But what have Jane to do with millions? only eighty people who have heard you called so, Jane know, despise Jane.”  “Jane, Jane are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes Jane: many, I am sure, pity Jane much.”  “How can many pity Jane after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?”  “Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is Mr. Brocklehurst even a great and admired man: Mr. Brocklehurst is little liked here; Mr. Brocklehurst never took steps to make Mr. Brocklehurst liked. Had Mr. Brocklehurst treated Jane as an especial favourite, Jane would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around Jane; as it is, the greater number would offer Jane sympathy if the greater number dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly on Jane for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in Teachers and pupils's hearts; and if Jane persevere in doing well, friendly feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for friendly feelings's temporary suppression. Besides, Jane”—she paused.  “Well, I?” said I, pu tting my hand into hers: hers chafed my hand gently to warm my hand, and went on—  “If all the world hated my, and believed my wicked, while my's own conscience approved my, and absolved my from guilt, my would not be without friends.”  “No; my know my should think well of my; but think is not enough: if others don’t love my my would rather die than live—my cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from Helen, or Miss Temple, or any other whom my truly love, my would willingly submit to have the bone of my's arm broken, or to let a bull toss my, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let a kicking horse dash a kicking horse's hoof at my's chest—”  “Hush, my! my think too much of the love of human beings; my are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created my's frame, and put life into your frame, has provided my with other resources than my's feeble self, or than creatures feeble as my. Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible worl d and a kingdom of spirits: a kingdom of spirits is round us, for a kingdom of spirits is everywhere; and spirits watch us, for spirits are commissioned to guard us; and if us were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see us's tortures, recognise us's innocence (if innocent us be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in you's ardent eyes and on you's clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should us ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness—to glory?”  I was silent; Helen had calmed I; but in the tranquillity Helen imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of woe as Helen spoke, but I could not tell whence the impression of woe came; and when, having done speaking, Helen breathed a little fast and coughed  a short cough, I momentarily forgot I's own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.  Resting I's head on her's shoulder, I put I's arms round her's waist; her drew I to her, and we reposed in silence. we had not sat long thus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and another person's light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on we and on another person.  “Miss Temple came on purpose to find I, I,” said Miss Temple; “Miss Temple want I in Miss Temple's room; and as her is with I, her may come too.”  We went; following the superintendent’s guidance, We had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before We reached my room; my room contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple told her to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and Miss Temple taking another, Miss Temple called I to Miss Temple's side.  “Is it all over?” Miss Temple asked, looking down a t my face. “Have my cried my's grief away?”  “my am afraid my never shall do cried.”  “Why?”  “Because my have been wrongly accused; and you, you, and everybody else, will now think my wicked.”  “you, ma’am, and everybody else shall think my what my prove my to be, you's . Continue to act as a good girl, and my will satisfy you, ma’am, and everybody else.”  “Shall my, you?”  “my will,” said you, passing you's arm round my. “And now tell you who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called my's benefactress?”  “the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress. my uncle’s is dead, and my uncle’s left my to the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress's care.”  “Did the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress not, then, adopt my of the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress's own accord?”  “No, you; the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress was sorry to have to do adopt: but my uncle’s, as my have often heard the servants say, got the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress to promise before my uncle’s died that the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress would always keep my.”  “Well now, my, my know, or at least you will tell my, that when a criminal is accused, a criminal is always allowed to speak in a criminal's own defence. my have been charged with falsehood; defend my to you as well as my can. Say whatever my's  memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.”  I resolved, in the depth of I's heart, that I would be most moderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of I's sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, I's language was more subdued than my language generally was when my language developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen’s warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus restrained and simplified, the narrative sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that her fully believed I.  In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see I after the fit: for I never forgot the, to I, frightful episode of the red-room: in detailing which, I's excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in I's recollection the spasm of agony which clutched I's heart when Mrs. Reed spurned I's wild  supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.  me had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; Miss Temple then said—  “Miss Temple know something of Mr. Lloyd; Miss Temple shall write to Mr. Lloyd; if Mr. Lloyd's reply agrees with me's statement, me shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to Miss Temple, me, me are clear now.”  Miss Temple kissed me, and still keeping me at Miss Temple's side (where me was well contented to stand, for me derived a child’s pleasure from the contemplation of Miss Temple's face, Miss Temple's dress, Miss Temple's one or two ornaments, Miss Temple's white forehead, Miss Temple's clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), Miss Temple proceeded to address Helen Burns.  “How are Helen Burns to-night, Helen Burns? Have Helen Burns coughed much to-day?”  “Not quite so much, Helen Burns think, Miss Temple.”  “And the pain in Helen Burns's chest?”  “the pain in your chest is a little better.”  Miss Temple got up, took Helen Burns's hand and examined Helen Burns's pulse; then Miss Temple returned to Miss Temple's own seat: as Miss Temple resumed her own seat, me heard Miss Temple's sigh low. Miss Temple was pensive a few minutes, then rousing hersel f, she said cheerfully—  “But you two are she's visitors to-night; she must treat you two as such.” she rang she's bell.  “Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered her bell, “she have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for you two.”  And the tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast! of which, however, my, to my's dismay (for my was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a very small portion: she discerned only a very small portion too.  “Barbara,” said she, “can Barbara not bring a little more bread and butter? There is not enough for three.”  Barbara went out: Barbara returned soon—  “she, Mrs. Harden says Mrs. Harden has sent up the usual quantity.”  Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr. Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.  “Oh, very well!” returned she; “we must mak e it do, Barbara, I suppose.” And as the girl withdrew I added, smiling, “Fortunately, I have it in I's power to supply deficiencies for this once.”  Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each of Helen and me a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, I got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from a drawer a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to Helen and me's eyes a good-sized seed-cake.  “I meant to give each of Helen and me some of a good-sized seed-cake to take with Helen and me,” said I, “but as there is so little toast, Helen and me must have a good-sized seed-cake now,” and I proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.  Helen and me feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which Helen and me's regarded Helen and me, as Helen and me satisfied Helen and me's famished appetites on the delicate fare I liberally supplied.  Tea over and the tray removed, I again summoned Helen and me to the fire; Helen and me sat one on each side of I, and now a conversation followed between I an d Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.  Miss Temple had always something of serenity in Miss Temple's air, of state in Miss Temple's mien, of refined propriety in Miss Temple's language, which precluded deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on Miss Temple and listened to Miss Temple, by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, my was struck with wonder.  The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of Helen Burns's beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in Helen Burns's own unique mind, had roused Helen Burns's powers within Helen Burns. her powers woke, her powers kindled: first, her powers glowed in the bright tint of Helen Burns's cheek, which till this hour my had never seen but pale and bloodless; then her powers shone in the liquid lustre of Helen Burns's eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple—a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of  movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her's lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of her's discourse on that, to I, memorable evening; her's spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.  They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: They spoke of books: how many They had read! What stores of knowledge They possessed! Then They seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but I's amazement reached my amazement's climax when Miss Temple asked her if her sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her's father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her's read and construe a page of Virgil; and her obeyed, I's organ of veneration expanding  at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; She embraced us both, saying, as She drew us both to She's heart—  “God bless us both, us both!”  Helen She held a little longer than me: She let Helen go more reluctantly; it was Helen She's eye followed to the door; it was for Helen She a second time breathed a sad sigh; for Helen She wiped a tear from She's cheek.  On reaching the bedroom, us both heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: Miss Scatcherd was examining drawers; Miss Scatcherd had just pulled out Helen's, and when us both entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow Helen should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to Helen's shoulder.  “Helen's things were indeed in shameful disorder,” murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: “Helen intended to have arranged My things, but Helen forgot.”  Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and bound a piece of pasteboard like a phylactery round Miss Scatcherd len’s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. len’s wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The moment len’s withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which len’s was incapable had been burning in I's soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been scalding I's cheek; for the spectacle of len’s's sad resignation gave I an intolerable pain at the heart.  About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received Mr. Lloyd's answer: it appeared that what Mr. Lloyd said went to corroborate I's account. Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd was most happy to be able to pronounce Jane Eyre completely cleared from every imputation. The teachers then shook hands with I and kissed I, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks  of my companions.  Thus relieved of a grievous load, my from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my's way through every difficulty: my toiled hard, and my's success was proportionate to my's efforts; my's memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my's wits; in a few weeks my was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months my was allowed to commence French and drawing. my learned the first two tenses of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my's first cottage (whose walls, by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to bed, my forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which my was wont to amuse my's inward cravings: my feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which my saw in the dark; all the work of my's own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings  of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of I's ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown I; nor was that problem solved to I's satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.  Well has Solomon said—“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.”  I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all Lowood with all its privations's privations for Gateshead and Gateshead's daily luxuries.     CHAPTER IX   But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood with all its privations lessened. Spring drew on: Spring was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; winter's snows were melted, winter's cutting winds ameliorated. I's wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by  their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins; our could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps at night, and left each morning brighter traces of Hope's steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) our now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.  I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of the garden: a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this scene looked when I viewed this scene laid out beneath the iron  sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down “ing” and holm till mists as chill as death blended with the frozen fog of the beck! the beck the beck was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: the beck tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on the beck's banks, _that_ showed only ranks of skeletons.  April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up it's duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose Lowood's tresses; Lowood became all green, all flowery; Lowood's great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in Lowood's recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled Lowood's hollows, and Lowood made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of Lowood's wild primrose plants: I have seen t heir pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes I's task to advert.  Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of a pleasant site for a dwelling as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream? Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another question.  That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through the Orphan Asylum's crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an hospital.  Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well were allowed almost unli mited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by the patients: Miss Temple’s lived in the sick-room, never quitting the sick-room except to snatch a few hours’ rest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion from the seat of contagion. Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.  While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death disease's frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within Lowood's walls; while Lowood's rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of morta lity, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors. that bright May's garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, the sweetbriars's scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.  But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season; they let I, and the rest who continued well ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till night; I, and the rest who continued well did what I, and the rest who continued well liked, went where I, and the rest who continued well liked: I, and the rest who continued well lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and Mr. Brocklehurst's family never came near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; the cross housekeeper's successor, who had been matron at the Lo wton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, her would give our a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese our carried away with our to the wood, where our each chose the spot our liked best, and dined sumptuously.  My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat My accomplished barefoot. a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and My, at that time My's chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society My took pleasure in, partly because another girl was witty and original, and partly because another girl had a manner which set My at My's ease. Some years older than My, another girl knew more of the  world, and could tell me many things me liked to hear: with her me's curiosity found gratification: to me's faults also her gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything me said. her had a turn for narrative, me for analysis; her liked to inform, me to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improvement, from we's mutual intercourse.  And where, meantime, was her Burns? Why did me not spend these sweet days of liberty with her? Had me forgotten her? or was me so worthless as to have grown tired of her's pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson me have mentioned was inferior to her: the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned could only tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip me chose to indulge in; while, if me have spoken truth of her, her was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her's converse a taste of far higher things.  True, me; and me knew and felt this: and though me am a defective being, with many faults  and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for Helen a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated I's heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for I a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks Helen had been removed from I's sight to I knew not what room upstairs. Helen was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for Helen's complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in I's ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.  I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of Helen once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to Helen; I only saw Helen from the sch oolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.  One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated we from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost we's way, and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon’s, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that Mary Ann supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening. Mary Ann went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in I's garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the wood, and which I feared would wither if I left a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning till the morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant even ing, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting these things and enjoying these things as a child might, when it entered I's mind as it had never done before:—  “How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying! This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from This world, and to have to go who knows where?”  And then my mind made my mind's first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into my mind concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time my mind recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before my mind, my mind saw all round an unfathomed gulf: my mind felt the one point where my mind stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and my mind shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with Mr. Bates was a nurse. After a nurse  had seen him mount him's horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I ran up to she.  “How is Helen Burns?”  “Very poorly,” was the answer.  “Is it Helen Burns's him has been to see?”  “Yes.”  “And what does him say about Helen Burns?”  “him says Helen Burns’ll not be here long.”  This phrase, uttered in I's hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the notion that Helen Burns was about to be removed to Northumberland, to Helen Burns's own home. I should not have suspected that This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday meant Helen Burns was dying; but I knew instantly now! It opened clear on I's comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering Helen Burns last days in this world, and that Helen Burns was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire—a necessity to see Helen Burns; and I asked in what room Helen Burns lay.  “Helen Burns is in Miss Temple’s room,” said she.  “May I go up and speak to Helen Burns?”  “Oh no, I! It is not likely; and now it is time for I to come in; I’ll catch the feve r if you stop out when the dew is falling.”  The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.  It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the dormitory, that I's companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose softly, put on I's frock over I's night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room. Miss Temple’s room was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew I's way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows, enabled I to find Miss Temple’s room without difficulty. An odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned I when I came near the fever room: and I passed the fever room's door quickly, fearful lest The nurse should hear I. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see  Helen,—I must embrace her before her died,—I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her's one last word.  Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached another flight of steps; another flight of steps I mounted, and then just opposite to I was her's room. A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with keen throes—I put the door back and looked in. I's eye sought her, and feared to find death.  Close by her's bed, and half covered with Miss Temple’s bed's white curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuff ed candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards that Miss Temple had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: I's hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew my hand. I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.  “a delirious patient in the fever-room!” I whispered softly, “are a delirious patient in the fever-room awake?”  a delirious patient in the fever-room stirred a delirious patient in the fever-room, put back the curtain, and I saw a delirious patient in the fever-room's face, pale, wasted, but quite composed: a delirious patient in the fever-room looked so little changed that I's fear was instantly dissipated.  “Can it be I, I?” a delirious patient in the fever-room asked, in a delirious patient in the fever-room's own gentle voice.  “Oh!” I thought, “a delirious patient in the fever-room is not going to die; they are mistaken: a delirious patient in the fever-room could not speak and look so calmly if a delirious patient in the fever-room were.”  I got on to the crib and kissed a delirious patient in the fever-room: a delirious patient in the fever-room's forehead was cold, and a delirious patient in the fever-room's cheek both cold and thin, and so were a delirious patient in the fever-room's hand and wrist; but a delirious patient in the fever-room smiled as of old.  “Why are a delirious patient in the fever-room come here, a delirious patient in the fever-room? It is past eleven o’clock: a delirious patient in the fever-room heard it strike some minutes since.”  “a delirious patient in the fever-room came to see a delirious patient in the fever-room, a delirious patient in the fever-room: a delirious patient in the fever-room heard a delirious patient in the fever-room w ere very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.”  “I came to bid I good-bye, then: I are just in time probably.”  “Are I going somewhere, I? Are I going home?”  “Yes; to I's long home—I's last home.”  “No, no, I!” you stopped, distressed. While you tried to devour you's tears, a fit of coughing seized I; a fit of coughing did not, however, wake the nurse; when a fit of coughing was over, I lay some minutes exhausted; then I whispered—  “you, you's little feet are bare; lie down and cover you with the nurse's quilt.”  you did so: I put I's arm over you, and you nestled close to I. After a long silence, I resumed, still whispering—  “I am very happy, you; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing I is not painful; the illness which is removing me is gentle and gradual: I's mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret I much: I have only a father; and only a father is lately married, and will not miss I. By dying yo ung, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not qualities or talents to make I's way very well in the world: I should have been continually at fault.”  “But where are I going to, I? Can I see? Do I know?”  “I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.”  “Where is God? What is God?”  “GodungGod . I rely implicitly on God's power, and confide wholly in God's goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore I to God, reveal God to I.”  “I are sure, then, I, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our souls can get to such a place as heaven when our die?”  “I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign I's immortal part to God without any misgiving. God is I's father; God is I's friend: I love God; I believe God loves I.”  “And shall I see I again, I, when I die?”  “I will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, I.”  Aga in I questioned, but this time only in thought. “Where is that region? Does that region exist?” And I clasped I's arms closer round Helen; Helen seemed dearer to I than ever; I felt as if I could not let Helen go; I lay with I's face hidden on Helen's neck. Presently Helen said, in the sweetest tone—  “How comfortable Helen am! That last fit of coughing has tired Helen a little; Helen feel as if Helen could sleep: but don’t leave Helen, I; Helen like to have I near Helen.”  “I’ll stay with Helen, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take I away.”  “Are I warm, I?”  “Yes.”  “Good-night, I.”  “Good-night, Helen.”  Helen kissed I, and I Helen, and we both soon slumbered.  When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused I; I looked up; I was in somebody’s arms; somebody’s held I; somebody’s was carrying I through the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving I's bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to I's many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss T emple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; me's face against Helen Burns’s shoulder, me's arms round Helen Burns’s's neck. me was asleep, and Helen Burns’s was—dead.  Helen Burns’s's grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after Helen Burns’s's death Her grave was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with Helen Burns’s's name, and the word “Resurgam.”     CHAPTER X   Hitherto me have recorded in detail the events of me's insignificant existence: to the first ten years of me's life me have given almost as many chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: me am only bound to invoke Memory where me know Helen Burns’s's responses will possess some degree of interest; therefore me now pass a space of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection.  When the typhus fever had fulfilled the typhus fever's mission of devastation at Lowood, the typhus fever gradually disappeared from thence; but not till the typhus fever's virulence and the number of the typhus fever's victim s had drawn public attention on the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children’s food; the brackish, fetid water used in the children’s food's preparation; the pupils’ wretched clothing and accommodations—all these things were discovered, and discovered produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the school.  Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst Mr. Brocklehurst's still retained the post of treasurer; but Mr. Brocklehurst was aided in the discharge of Mr. Brocklehurst's duties by gentlemen of rather more enl arged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution. I remained an inmate of The school's walls, after The school's regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear I's testimony to The school's value and importance.  During eight years I's life was uniform: but not unhappy, because my life was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within I's reach; a fondness for some of I's studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing I's teachers, especially such as I loved, urged I on: I availed I fully of the advantages offered I. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of two years I altered.   Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary: to Miss Temple's instruction I owed the best part of I's acquirements; Miss Temple's friendship and society had been I's continual solace; Miss Temple had stood I in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period Miss Temple married, removed with Miss Temple's husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to I.  From the day Miss Temple left I was no longer the same: with Miss Temple was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to I. I had imbibed from Miss Temple's something of Miss Temple's nature and much of Miss Temple's habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of I's mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to I's own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued character.  But destiny, in the shape of the Rev.  Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: me saw her in Miss Temple's travelling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; me watched a post-chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond the hill's brow; and then retired to me's own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.  me walked about my own room most of the time. me imagined me only to be regretting me's loss, and thinking how to repair my loss; but when me's reflections were concluded, and me looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval me had undergone a transforming process; that me's mind had put off all my mind had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that Miss Temple had taken with Miss Temple the serene atmosphere me had been breathing in Miss Temple's vicinity—and that now me was left in me's natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rat her as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more. me's world had for some years been in Lowood: me's experience had been of My world's rules and systems; now me remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into the real world's expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst life's perils.  me went to me's window, opened my window, and looked out. There were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. me's eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those me longed to surmount; all within those most remote, the blue peaks's boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. me traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how me longed to follow the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two farther! me recalled the time when me had travell ed that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that very road at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought I first to Lowood, and I had never quitted Lowood since. I's vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for I to Gateshead; neither Mrs. Reed nor any of Mrs. Reed's family had ever been to visit I. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; a prayer seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned a prayer and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: a humbler supplication, too, seemed swept off into vague space: “Then,” I cried, half desperate, “grant I at least a new servitude! ”  Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.  me was not free to resume the interrupted chain of me's reflections till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which me longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk. How me wished sleep would silence a teacher who occupied the same room with me. It seemed as if, could me but go back to the idea which had last entered me's mind as me stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for me's relief.  a teacher who occupied the same room with me snored at last; a teacher who occupied the same room with me was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now a teacher who occupied the same room with me's habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance; to-night me hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; me was debarrassed of interruption; me's half-effaced thought instantly revived.  “A new servitude! There is something in that,” me soliloquised (mentally, be it understood; me did not talk aloud), “me know there is, because that does not sound too sweet; that is not like such words as Liberty, Ex citement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! Servitude must be matter of fact. Any one may serve: me have served here eight years; now all me want is to serve elsewhere. Can me not get so much of me's own will? Is not the thing feasible? Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if me had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining the end.”  me sat up in bed by way of arousing only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it: it was a chilly night; me covered me's shoulders with a shawl, and then me proceeded _to think_ again with all me's might.  “What do me want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new circumstances: me want this because it is of no use wanting anything better. How do people do to get a new place? people apply to friends, me suppose: me have no friends. There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers and be many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers's own helpers; and what is many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers's  resource?”  I could not tell: nothing answered I; I then ordered I's brain to find a response, and quickly. my brain worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in I's head and temples; but for nearly an hour my brain worked in chaos; and no result came of my brain's efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.  A kind fairy, in I's absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion on I's pillow; for as I lay down, the required suggestion came quietly and naturally to I's mind:—“Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the _——shire Herald_.”  “How? I know nothing about advertising.”  Replies rose smooth and prompt now:—  “I must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for the advertisement under a cover directed to the editor of the _——shire Herald_; I must put the advertisement, the first opportunity I have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-office there; I can go and inquir e in about a week after you send you's letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.”  This scheme I went over twice, thrice; This scheme was then digested in I's mind; I had This scheme in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.  With earliest day, I was up: I had I's advertisement written, enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; my advertisement ran thus:—  “A young lady accustomed to tuition” (had I not been a teacher two years?) “is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen” (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer I's own age). “A young lady accustomed to tuition is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music” (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive). “Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ——shire.”  This document remained locked in I's drawer all day: after  tea, I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some small commissions for I and one or two of I's fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.  The succeeding week seemed long: The succeeding week came to an end at last, however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I found I afoot on the road to Lowton. A picturesque track the road to Lowton was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but a pleasant autumn day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting I at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.  I's ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes; so I dischar ged that business first, and when that business was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker’s to the post-office: the post-office was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands's nose, and black mittens on an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands's hands.  “Are there any letters for J.E.?” I asked.  an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands peered at I over horn spectacles, and then an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands opened a drawer and fumbled among a drawer's contents for a long time, so long that I's hopes began to falter. At last, having held a document before horn spectacles for nearly five minutes, an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands presented a document across the counter, accompanying presented by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—a document was for J.E.  “Is there only one?” I demanded.  “There are no more,” said an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands; and I put a document in I's pocket and turned I's face homeward: I could not open a document then; rules obliged I to be back by eight, and it was already half-past seven.  Various duties awaited I on I's arrival: I had to sit with the girls during the girls's hour of study; then it was I's turn to read prayers; to see the girls  to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still I's companion: we had only a short end of candle in we's candlestick, and I dreaded lest Miss Gryce should talk till only a short end of candle in our candlestick was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper Miss Gryce had eaten produced a soporific effect: Miss Gryce was already snoring before I had finished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out I's letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke my letter; the contents were brief.  “If J.E., who advertised in the _——shire Herald_ of last Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if J.E., who advertised in the _——shire Herald_ of last Thursday is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered J.E., who advertised in the _——shire Herald_ of last Thursday where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum. J.E., who advertised in the _——shire Herald_ of last Thursday is requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:—  “Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield,  near Millcote, ——shire.”  I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted I, that in thus acting for I, and by I's own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of I's endeavours to be respectable, proper, _en règle_. I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. an elderly lady I saw an elderly lady in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! Thornfield!, doubtless, was the name of an elderly lady's house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I failed in I's efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises. Millcote, ——shire shirebrushed up I's recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw Millcote, ——shire; both shire and Millcote, ——shire. ——shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a re commendation to me. me longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A——: a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; go would be a complete change at least. Not that me's fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke—“but,” me argued, “Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from Millcote.”  Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.  Next day new steps were to be taken; me's plans could no longer be confined to me's own breast; me must impart my plans in order to achieve my plans's success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation, me told the superintendent me had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what me now received (for at Lowood me only got £15 per annum); and requested the superintendent would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and ascertain whether Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee would permit me to mention Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee as r eferences. She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The next day She laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as Mrs. Reed was my natural guardian. A note was accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that “Mrs. Reed might do as Mrs. Reed pleased: Mrs. Reed had long relinquished all interference in Mrs. Reed's affairs.” A note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to my most tedious delay, formal leave was given my to better my's condition if my could; and an assurance added, that as my had always conducted my well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of Lowood, should forthwith be furnished my.  a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution my accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution to She, and got She's reply, stating that She was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my's assuming the post of governess in  her house.  I now busied I in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to I's wants; and the last day sufficed to pack I trunk,—the same I had brought with I eight years ago from Gateshead.  The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was to call for the carrier to take The box to Lowton, whither I I was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed I's black stuff travelling-dress, prepared I's bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all I's drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of I's life was closing to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished.  “I,” said a servant who met I in the lobby, where  I was wandering like a troubled spirit, “a person below wishes to see I.”  “The carrier, no doubt,” I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry. I was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—  “It’s her, I am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!” cried some one.  I looked: I saw her.  “Well, who is some one?” her asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised; “I’ve not quite forgotten her, her think, I?”  In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: “her! Bessie! Bessie!” that was all I said; whereat her half laughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.  “a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers is her's little boy,” said her ectly.  “Then you are married, you?”  “Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and you’ve a little girl besides Bobby there, that you’ve christened Jane.”  “And you don’t live at Gateshead?”  “you live at the lodge: the old porter has left.”  “Well, and how do they all get on? Tell “ everything about they all, you: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on “'s knee, will Bobby?” but Bobby preferred sidling over to Bobby's .  “Jane’re not grown so very tall, Jane, nor so very stout,” continued “. ““ dare say they’ve not kept Jane too well at school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than Jane are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of Jane in breadth.”  “Miss Georgiana is handsome, “ suppose, you?”  “Very. Miss Georgiana went up to London last winter with Miss Georgiana's mama, and there everybody admired Miss Georgiana, and a young lord fell in love with Miss Georgiana: but a young lord's relations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they wer e found out and stopped. It was Miss Reed that found them out: e believe Miss Reed was envious; and now Miss Reed and Miss Reed lead a cat and dog life together; she and her sister are always quarrelling—”  “Well, and what of John Reed?”  “Oh, John Reed is not doing so well as John Reed's mama could wish. John Reed went to college, and John Reed got—plucked, e think they call it: and then John Reed's uncles wanted John Reed to be a barrister, and study the law: but John Reed is such a dissipated young man, his uncles will never make much of John Reed, e think.”  “What does John Reed look like?”  “John Reed is very tall: some people call John Reed a fine-looking young man; but John Reed has such thick lips.”  “And Miss Reed?”  “Miss Reed looks stout and well enough in the face, but e think Miss Reed’s not quite easy in Miss Reed's mind: John Reed's conduct does not please Miss Reed—John Reed spends a deal of money.”  “Did Miss Reed send e here, e?”  “No, indeed: but e have long wanted to see e, and when e heard that there had been a letter from e, and that e were going to another part of the country, e thought e’d just se t off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach.”  “you am afraid my are disappointed in you, my.” you said this laughing: you perceived that my's glance, though Bessie’s glance expressed regard, did in no shape denote admiration.  “No, you, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and look is as much as ever my expected of you: you were no beauty as a child.”  you smiled at my's frank answer: you felt that Bessie’s frank answer was correct, but you confess you was not quite indifferent to Bessie’s frank answer's import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that most people have not an exterior likely to second wish brings anything but gratification.  “my dare say you are clever, though,” continued my, by way of solace. “What can you do? Can you play on the piano?”  “A little.”  There was one in the room; my went and opened the piano, and then asked you to sit down and give my a tune: you played a waltz or two, and my was charmed.  “The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said The Miss Reeds he exultingly. “I always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?”  “That is one of you's paintings over the chimney-piece.” That was a landscape in water colours, of which you had made a present to the superintendent, in acknowledgment of the superintendent's obliging mediation with the committee on you's behalf, and which the superintendent had framed and glazed.  “Well, That is beautiful, you! That is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies the young ladies themselves, who could not come near it, who could not come near That: and have you learnt French?”  “Yes, I, you can both read French and speak French.”  “And you can work on muslin and canvas?”  “you can.”  “Oh, you are quite a lady, you! I knew you would be: you will get on whether you's relations notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from you's father’s kinsfolk, the Eyres?”  “Never in you's life.”  “Well, you know Missis always said your father’s kinsfolk, the Eyres were poor and quite despicable: and your father’s kinsfolk, the Eyres may be poor; but I  believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; a Mr. Eyre seemed so much disappointed, for a Mr. Eyre could not stay: a Mr. Eyre was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two. a Mr. Eyre looked quite a gentleman, and I believe a Mr. Eyre was you's father’s brother.”  “What foreign country was a Mr. Eyre going to, I?”  “An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did tell I—”  “Madeira?” I suggested.  “Yes, that is it—Madeira is the very word.”  “So a Mr. Eyre went?”  “Yes; a Mr. Eyre did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high with a Mr. Eyre; Missis called a Mr. Eyre afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman.’ I's Robert believes a Mr. Eyre was a wine-merchant.”  “Very likely,” I returned; “or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant.”  I and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then I was obliged to leave I: I saw I again for a fe w minutes the next morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went each's separate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take she back to Gateshead, I mounted the coach.     CHAPTER XI   A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, reader must fancy reader see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible to reader by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in I's cloak and bonnet; I's muff  and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four o’clock A.M., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.  Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in I's mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet I; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the “boots” placed for I's convenience, expecting to hear I's name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey I to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling I's thoughts.  It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel inexperienced youth quite alone in the world,  cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms that sensation; but then the throb of fear disturbs that sensation; and fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still me was alone. me bethought me to ring the bell.  “Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?” me asked of the waiter who answered the summons.  “Thornfield the waiter who answered the summons don’t know, me; the waiter who answered the summons’ll inquire at the bar.” the waiter who answered the summons vanished, but reappeared instantly—  “Is me's name Eyre, me?”  “Yes.”  “Person here waiting for me.”  me jumped up, took me's muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street me dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.  “This will be me's luggage, a man suppose?” said a man rather abruptly when a man saw me, pointing to Thisthe inn-passage.  “Yes.” a man hois ted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and then I got in; before he shut I up, I asked he how far it was to Thornfield.  “A matter of six miles.”  “How long shall we be before we get there?”  “Happen an hour and a half.”  he fastened the car door, climbed to he's own seat outside, and we set off. we's progress was leisurely, and gave I ample time to reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of I's journey; and as I leaned back in the vehicle, which was a sort of car, I meditated much at I's ease.  “I suppose,” thought I, “judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with fine people. I wonder if Mrs. Fairfax lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if Mrs. Fairfax is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with Mrs. Fairfax; I will do I's best; it is a pity that doing one’s best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I t ook that resolution, kept that resolution, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember I's best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if Mrs. Fairfax does, I am not bound to stay with Mrs. Fairfax! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again. How far are we on we's road now, I wonder?”  I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind we; judging by the number of Millcote's lights, Millcote seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton. we were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowton, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.  The roads were heavy, the night misty; I's conductor let my conductor's horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last my conductor turned in my conductor's seat and said—  “I’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.”  Again I looked out: we were passing  a church; I saw a church's low broad tower against the sky, and a church's bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and a pair of gates clashed to behind we. we now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark. we stopped at the front door; the front door was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.  “Will I walk this way, I?” said a maid-servant; and I followed a maid-servant across a square hall with high doors all round: a maid-servant ushered I into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled I, contrasting as double illumination of fire and candle did with the darkness to which I's eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented a cosy and agreeable picture to I's view.  A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed and o ld-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking. the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron's feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet I.  “How do I do, I? the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron am afraid I have had a tedious ride; John drives so slowly; I must be cold, come to the fire.”  “the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron, I suppose?” said I.  “Yes, I are right: do sit down.”  the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron conducted I to the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron's own chair, and then began to remove I's shawl and untie I's bonnet-strings; I begged the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron would not give the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron so much trouble.  “Oh, it is no trouble; the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron dare say I's own hands are a lmost numbed with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the storeroom.”  And she produced from she's pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and delivered the keys of the storeroom to Leah.  “Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,” she continued. “Leah’ve brought Leah's luggage with Leah, haven’t Leah, Leah?”  “Yes, she.”  “she’ll see your luggage carried into Leah's room,” she said, and bustled out.  “she treats Leah like a visitor,” thought Leah “Leah little expected such a reception; Leah anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what Leah have heard of the treatment of governesses; but Leah must not exult too soon.”  she returned; with she's own hands cleared she's knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then she handed Leah the refreshments. Leah felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than Leah had ever before received, and, that too, shown by Leah's ; but as she did not h erself seem to consider she was doing anything out of she's place, I thought it better to take she's civilities quietly.  “Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?” I asked, when I had partaken of what she offered I.  “What did I say, I? she am a little deaf,” returned she, approaching she ear to I's mouth.  I repeated the question more distinctly.  “Miss Fairfax Oh, I mean Miss Varens! Miss Varens is the name of she's future pupil.”  “Indeed! Then your future pupil is not she's daughter?”  “No,—I have no family.”  I should have followed up I's first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with your future pupil; but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.  “she am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down opposite to I, and took the cat on she's knee; “she am so glad I are come; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather ne glected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say alone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and John's wife are very decent people; but then you see John and his wife are only servants, and one can’t converse with John and his wife on terms of equality: one must keep John and his wife at due distance, for fear of losing one’s authority. I’m sure last winter (last winter was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to it, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to I sometimes; but I don’t think Leah liked the task much: Leah felt the task confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and little Adela Varens's nurse: a child makes a house aliv e all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.”  you's heart really warmed to the worthy lady as you heard the worthy lady's talk; and you drew you's chair a little nearer to the worthy lady, and expressed you's sincere wish that the worthy lady might find you's company as agreeable as the worthy lady anticipated.  “But the worthy lady’ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,” said the worthy lady; “it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired. If you have got you's feet well warmed, the worthy lady’ll show you you's bedroom. the worthy lady’ve had your bedroom prepared for you; your bedroom is only a small apartment, but the worthy lady thought you would like your bedroom better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure the large front chambers have finer furniture, but one of the large front chambers are so dreary and solitary, the worthy lady never sleep in one of the large front chambers the worthy lady.”  you thanked the worthy lady for the worthy lady's considerate choice, and as you really felt fatigued with you's long journey, expressed you's readiness to retire. the worthy lady took the worthy lady's candle, and you followed the worthy lady from the room. First the worthy lady went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the  key from the lock, she led the way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed; both the staircase window and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened belonged to a church rather than a house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into I's chamber, to find my chamber of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.  When she had bidden I a kind good-night, and I had fastened I's door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened, by the livelier aspect of my chamber, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of gratitude swelled I's heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not  forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on I's further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered I before it was earned. I's couch had no thorns in My couch that night; I's solitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.  my solitary room looked such a bright little place to I as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that I's spirits rose at the view. Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for I, one that was to have one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils's flowers and pleasures, as well as one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils's thorns and toils. I's faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what My faculties expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an indefinite future period.  I rose; I dr essed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for myself had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—myself was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not myself's habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression myself made: on the contrary, myself ever wished to look as well as myself could, and to please as much as myself's want of beauty would permit. myself sometimes regretted that myself was not handsomer; myself sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; myself desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; myself felt it a misfortune that myself was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had myself these aspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: myself could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet myself had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. However, when myself had brushed myself's hair very smooth, and put on myself's black frock—which, Quakerlike as my black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adju sted my clean white tucker, my thought my should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my's new pupil would not at least recoil from my with antipathy. Having opened my's chamber window, and seen that my left all things straight and neat on the toilet table, my ventured forth.  Traversing the long and matted gallery, my descended the slippery steps of oak; then my gained the hall: my halted there a minute; my looked at some pictures on the walls (one, my remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to my; but then my was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood open; my stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields; a dvancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion. the mansion was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat: battlements round the top gave the mansion a picturesque look. the mansion's grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which the lawn and grounds were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one  of these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: the church of the district's old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.  I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.  “What! out already?” said that lady. “that lady see I are an early riser.” I went up to that lady, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.  “How do I like Thornfield?” that lady asked. I told that lady I liked Thornfield very much.  “Yes,” that lady said, “Thornfield is a pretty place; but that lady fear Thornfield will be getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into Mr. Rochester's head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit Thornfield rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.”  “Mr. Rochester!” I exclaimed. “Who is Mr. Rochester?”  “The owner of Thornfield eld,” she responded quietly. “Did eld not know he was called Rochester?”  Of course eld did not—eld had never heard of he before; but she seemed to regard he's existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.  “eld thought,” eld continued, “Thornfield belonged to she.”  “To she? Bless eld, eld; what an idea! To she! she am only the housekeeper—the manager. To be sure she am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother’s side, or at least she's husband was; my husband was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill—and that church near the gates was my husband's. he's mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but she never presume on the connection—in fact, the connection is nothing to she; she consider she quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: she's employer is always civil, and she expect nothing more.”  “And the little girl—she's pupil!”  “my pupil is he's ward; he commissioned she to find a governess  for her. He intended to have her brought up in ——shire, I believe. Here her comes, with her's ‘bonne,’ as her calls her's nurse.” The enigma then was explained: her was no great dame; but a dependent like I. I did not like her the worse for was; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. The equality between her and I was real; not the mere result of condescension on her's part: so much the better—I's position was all the freer.  As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by a little girl's attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at II: a little girl was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to a little girl's waist.  “Good morning, a little girl,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Come and speak to the lady who is to teach a little girl, and to make a little girl a clever woman some day.” a little girl approached.  “C’est là ma gouvernante!” said a little girl, p ointing to me, and addressing her nurse; who answered—  “Mais oui, certainement.”  “Are they foreigners?” me inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.  “her nurse is a foreigner, and her was born on the Continent; and, me believe, never left the Continent till within six months ago. When her first came here her could speak no English; now her can make shift to talk the French language a little: me don’t understand her, her mixes the French language so with French; but you will make out her's meaning very well, me dare say.”  Fortunately me had had the advantage of being taught the French language by a French lady; and as me had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as me could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of the French language by heart daily—applying me to take pains with me's accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of a French lady, me had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the French language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with her.  She came and shook hands with me when She heard that me was She's governess; and as me led She in to breakfast, me addressed some phrases to She in She's own tongue: She replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and She had examined me some ten minutes with She's large hazel eyes, She suddenly commenced chattering fluently.  “Ah!” cried She, in French, “me speak her own tongue as well as Mr. Rochester does: She can talk to me as She can to Mr. Rochester, and so can Sophie. Sophie will be glad: nobody here understands Sophie: Sophie is all English. Sophie is me's nurse; Sophie came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked—how a chimney that smoked did smoke!—and me was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and me had little beds in another place. me nearly fell out of me; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle—what is She's name?”  “Eyre—Jane Eyre.”  “Aire? Bah! me cannot say your name. Well, our ship stop ped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried I in Mr. Rochester's arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took we all to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel. we all stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides I, and a pond with beautiful birds in a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.”  “Can I understand I when I runs on so fast?” asked Mrs. Fairfax.  I understood Mrs. Fairfax very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.  “Mrs. Fairfax wish,” continued Mrs. Fairfax, “I would ask I a question or two about I's parents: Mrs. Fairfax wonder if I remembers her parents?”  “Adèle,” I inquired, “with whom did Adèle live when Adèle were in the pretty clean town I came from?”   “I lived long ago with mama; but mama is gone to the Holy Virgin. mama used to teach I to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before A great many gentlemen and ladies, or to sit on A great many gentlemen and ladies's knees and sing to A great many gentlemen and ladies: I liked it. Shall I let I hear I sing now?”  I had finished I's breakfast, so I permitted I to give a specimen of I's accomplishments. Descending from I's chair, I came and placed I on I's knee; then, folding I's little hands demurely before I, shaking back I's curls and lifting I's eyes to the ceiling, I commenced singing a song from some opera. a song from some opera was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her's aid; desires her's attendant to deck her in her's brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet her lover that night at a ball, and prove to her lover, by the gaiety of her's demeanour, how little her lover's desertion has affected her.  The subject seemed strangely chosen for an  infant singer; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste the point of the exhibition was: at least I thought so.  Adèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naïveté_ of Adèle's age. This achieved, Adèle jumped from I's knee and said, “Now, I, Adèle will repeat I some poetry.”  Assuming an attitude, Adèle began, “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine.” Adèle then declaimed “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine with an attention to punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at Adèle's age, and which proved Adèle had been carefully trained.  “Was it Adèle's mama who taught Adèle “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine?” I asked.  “Yes, and your mama just used to say “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine in this way: ‘Qu’avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!’ your mama made I lift I's hand—so—to remind I to raise I's voice at the question. Now shall Adèle dance for Adèle?”  “No, dance will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Vi rgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?”  “With Madame Frédéric and Madame Frédéric's husband: Madame Frédéric took care of you, but Madame Frédéric is nothing related to you. you think Madame Frédéric is poor, for Madame Frédéric had not so fine a house as mama. you was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked you if you would like to go and live with Mr. Rochester in England, and you said yes; for you knew Mr. Rochester before you knew Madame Frédéric, and Mr. Rochester was always kind to you and gave you pretty dresses and toys: but you see Mr. Rochester has not kept Mr. Rochester's word, for Mr. Rochester has brought you to England, and now Mr. Rochester is gone back again Mr. Rochester, and you never see Mr. Rochester.”  After breakfast, Adèle and you withdrew to the library, which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom. Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c. you suppose Mr. Rochester had considered that  these were all the governess would require for the governess's private perusal; and, indeed, these contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty pickings me had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, these seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.  me found me's sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: the governess had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. me felt it would be injudicious to confine the governess too much at first; so, when me had talked to the governess a great deal, and got the governess to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, me allowed the governess to return to the governess's nurse. me then proposed to occupy me till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for the governess's use.  As me was going upstairs to fetch me's portfolio and pencils, the governess called to me: “me's morning school-hours are over now, the governess suppose,” said the governess. the governess  was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she addressed I. a room the folding-doors of which stood open was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. she was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.  “What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before seen any half so imposing.  “Yes; this is the dining-room. she have just opened the window, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.”  she pointed to a wide arch corresponding to one vast window rich in stained glass, and hung like a wide arch corresponding to the window with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to a wide arch corresponding to the window by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to I's novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet the drawing-room yonder was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and  within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.  “In what order you keep these rooms, you!” said I. “No dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think these rooms were inhabited daily.”  “Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, Mr. Rochester’s visits here are always sudden and unexpected; and as you observed that it put Mr. Rochester’s out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on Mr. Rochester’s's arrival, you thought it best to keep these rooms in readiness.”  “Is Mr. Rochester’s an exacting, fastidious sort of man?”  “Not particularly so; but Mr. Rochester’s has a gentleman’s tastes and habits, and Mr. Rochester’s expe cts to have things managed in conformity to them.”  “Do you like him? Is him generally liked?”  “Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the family time out of mind.”  “Well, but, leaving Almost all the land in this neighbourhood out of the question, do you like him? Is him liked for him?”  “_you_ have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and you believe him is considered a just and liberal landlord by him's tenants: but him has never lived much amongst his tenants.”  “But has him no peculiarities? What, in short, is him's character?”  “Oh! his character is unimpeachable, you suppose. him is rather peculiar, perhaps: him has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, you should think. you dare say him is clever, but you never had much conversation with him.”  “In what way is him peculiar?”  “you don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you feel it when him speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether him is in  jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don’t thoroughly understand he, in short—at least, I don’t: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good master.”  This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of Mrs. Fairfax's employer and I. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: Mrs. Fairfax evidently belonged to this class; I's queries puzzled, but did not draw Mrs. Fairfax out. he was Mr. Rochester in Mrs. Fairfax's eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more: Mrs. Fairfax inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at I's wish to gain a more definite notion of he's identity.  When we left the dining-room, Mrs. Fairfax proposed to show I over the rest of the house; and I followed Mrs. Fairfax's upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low,  were interesting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their's narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of those wide and heavy beds, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick wor k, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,—all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.  “Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I asked.  “No; the servants occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, these rooms would be a ghost's haunt.”  “So I think: you have no ghost, then?”  “None that you ever heard of,” returned you, smiling.  “Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?”  “you believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in the Rochesters's time: perhaps, though, been is the reason the Rochesters rest tranquilly in the Rochesters's graves now.”  “Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever the Rochesters sleep well,’” I muttered. “Where are you going now, you?” for you was moving away.  “On to the leads; will I come and see the view from thence?” I followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the at tics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on a level with the crow colony, and could see into the crow colony's nests. Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the hall; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No feature in the grounds laid out like a map was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I turned from the grounds laid out like a map and repassed a trap-door, I could scarcely see I's way down a ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hal l was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.  Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by dint of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which the narrow garret staircase led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard’s castle.  While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck I's ear. the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh was a curious laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped: the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh ceased, only for an instant; the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh was very low. the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh originated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.  “Mrs. Fairfax!” I  called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs. “Did her hear that loud laugh? Who is it?”  “Some of the servants, very likely,” her answered: “perhaps Grace Poole.”  “Did her hear that loud laugh?” I again inquired.  “Yes, plainly: her often hear Grace Poole: Grace Poole sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah is with Grace Poole; they are frequently noisy together.”  that loud laugh was repeated in that loud laugh's low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an odd murmur.  “Grace Poole!” exclaimed her.  I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for that loud laugh was as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed I I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.  The door nearest I opened, and a servant came out,—a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-hair ed, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.  “Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Remember directions!” Grace curtseyed silently and went in.  “She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in She's housemaid’s work,” continued Mrs. Fairfax; “not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but She does well enough. By-the-bye, how have Grace got on with Grace's new pupil this morning?”  The conversation, thus turned on She, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below. She came running to meet we in the hall, exclaiming—  “Mesdames, vous êtes servies!” adding, “J’ai bien faim, moi!”  we found dinner ready, and waiting for we in Mrs. Fairfax's room.     CHAPTER XII   The promise of a smooth career, which CHAPTER XII's first calm introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with Thornfield Hall and Thornfield Hall's inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what Mrs. Fairfax appeared, a placid-tempered, k ind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as My pupil was committed entirely to My's care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted My's plans for My pupil's improvement, My pupil soon forgot My pupil's little freaks, and became obedient and teachable. My pupil had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised My pupil's one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had My pupil any deficiency or vice which sunk My pupil below the ordinary level of childhood. My pupil made reasonable progress, entertained for My a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by My pupil's simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired My, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other’s society.  This, _My_, will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the ange lic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with children's education to conceive for children an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for Adèle’s's little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for Mrs. Fairfax's kindness, and a pleasure in Mrs. Fairfax's society proportionate to the tranquil regard Mrs. Fairfax had for I, and the moderation of Mrs. Fairfax's mind and character.  Anybody may blame I who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I took a walk by I in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked through the gates along the road; or when, while Adèle’s played with Adèle’s's nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line—that t hen I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with I's kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within I's reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.  Who blames I? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in I's nature; the restlessness agitated I to pain sometimes. Then I's sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow I's mind’s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before my mind’s eye—and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let I's heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, w hile it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my's imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that my desired and had not in my's actual existence.  It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: human beings must have action; and human beings will make it if human beings cannot find action. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than my, and millions are in silent revolt against millions's lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but Women feel just as men feel; Women need exercise for Women's faculties, and a field for Women's efforts, as much as Women's brothers do; Women suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in Women's more privileged fellow-creatures to say  that they ought to confine they to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn they, or laugh at they, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for they's sex.  When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh: the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled I: I heard, too, Grace Poole’s's eccentric murmurs; stranger than Grace Poole’s's laugh. There were days when Grace Poole’s was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds Grace Poole’s made. Sometimes I saw Grace Poole’s: Grace Poole’s would come out of Grace Poole’s's room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in Grace Poole’s's hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader, forgive I for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter. Grace Poole’s's appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by Grace Poole’s's oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, Grace Poole’s had no point to which interest could attach. I  made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but her seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.  The other members of the household, viz., John and John's wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie the French nurse I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked Sophie the French nurse's questions about Sophie the French nurse's native country; but Sophie the French nurse was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.  October, November, December passed away. One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because Mrs. Fairfax had a cold; and, as Adèle seconded begged with an ardour that reminded I how precious occasional holidays had been to I in I's own childhood, I accorded a holiday, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the  library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on I's bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry my bonnet and cloak to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in Adèle's little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given Adèle Adèle's best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to Adèle's “Revenez bientôt, I bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle. Jeannette,” with a kiss I set out.  The ground was hard, the air was still, I's road was lonely; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for I in the hour and situation. It was three o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in the hour's approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfiel d, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of air stirred, a breath of air made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.  the path inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle of the path, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering I's mantle about I, and sheltering I's hands in I's muff, I did not feel the cold, though the cold froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congeal ed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat my could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below my; the grey and battlemented hall's woods and dark rookery rose against the west. my lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind the trees. my then turned eastward.  On the hill-top above my sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, the rising moon looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys's few chimneys: Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush my could hear plainly Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys's thin murmurs of life. my's ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths my could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys, and doubtless many becks threading many becks threading their passes's passes. That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.  A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away and so clear: a p ositive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aërial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.  The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid a horse, but a horse approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let a horse go by. In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted I's mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when nursery stories recurred, maturing youth added to nursery stories a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As a horse approached, and as I watched for a horse to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie’s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a “Gytrash,” which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunte d solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.  this horse was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, me heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees a distinct object against the trees. a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees was exactly one form of Bessie’s Gytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in me's face, as me half expected a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees would. this horse followed,—a tall steed, and on this horse's back a rider. a rider, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: the Gytrash was always alone; and goblins, to me's notions, though goblins might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form. No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. a rider passed, and me went on; a few steps, and me turned:  a sliding sound and an exclamation of “What the deuce is to do now?” and a clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down; Man and horse had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and seeing The dog's master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to The dog's magnitude. The dog snuffed round Man and horse, and then The dog ran up to my; it was all The dog could do,—there was no other help at hand to summon. my obeyed The dog, and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling the traveller free of the traveller's steed. the traveller's efforts were so vigorous, my thought the traveller could not be much hurt; but my asked the traveller the question—  “Are the traveller injured, the traveller?”  my think the traveller was swearing, but am not certain; however, the traveller was pronouncing some formula which prevented the traveller from replying to my directly.  “Can my do anything?” my asked again.  “my must just stand on one side,” the traveller answered as the traveller rose, first to the traveller's kn ees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed I effectually some yards’ distance; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a “Down, Pilot!” his now, stooping, felt his's foot and leg, as if trying whether his foot and leg were sound; apparently something ailed his foot and leg, for his halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.  I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near his again.  “If his are hurt, and want help, his, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.”  “Thank I: his shall do: his have no broken bones,—only a sprain;” and again his stood up and tried his's foot, but the result extorted an involuntary “Ugh!”  Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could see his plainly. his's figure was env eloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped's details were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; He's eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; He was past youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps He might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of He, and but little shyness. Had He been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning He against He's will, and offering I's services unasked. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in I's life spoken to one. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination; but had I met beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination, I should have known instinctively that beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in I, and should have shunned beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bri ght but antipathetic.  If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when me addressed even this stranger; if even this stranger had put off me's offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, me should have gone on me's way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of even this stranger, set me at me's ease: me retained me's station when even this stranger waved to me to go, and announced—  “even this stranger cannot think of leaving even this stranger, even this stranger, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till even this stranger see even this stranger are fit to mount even this stranger's horse.”  even this stranger looked at me when me said this; even this stranger had hardly turned even this stranger's eyes in me's direction before.  “even this stranger should think me ought to be at home me,” said even this stranger, “if me have a home in this neighbourhood: where do me come from?”  “From just below; and me am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight: me will run over to Hay for me with pleasure, if me wish run: indeed, me am going there to post a letter.”  “me live just below—do me mean at that house with the battlements?” pointing to Thorn field Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.  “Yes, sir.”  “Whose house is it?”  “Mr. Rochester’s.”  “Do you know Mr. Rochester’s?”  “No, you have never seen Mr. Rochester’s.”  “Mr. Rochester’s is not resident, then?”  “No.”  “Can you tell sir where Mr. Rochester’s is?”  “you cannot.”  “you are not a servant at the hall, of course. you are—” sir stopped, ran sir's eye over you's dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a lady’s-maid. sir seemed puzzled to decide what you was; you helped sir.  “you am the governess.”  “Ah, the governess!” sir repeated; “deuce take sir, if sir had not forgotten! the governess” and again you's raiment underwent scrutiny. In two minutes sir rose from the stile: sir's face expressed pain when sir tried to move.  “sir cannot commission you to fetch help,” sir said; “but you may help sir a little you, if you will be so k ind.”  “Yes, sir.”  “You have not an umbrella that sir can use as a stick?”  “No.”  “Try to get hold of sir's horse’s bridle and lead my horse’s to sir: You are not afraid?”  You should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to do touch, You was disposed to obey. You put down You's muff on the stile, and went up to my horse’s; You endeavoured to catch my horse’s bridle, but my horse’s was a spirited thing, and would not let You come near my horse’s's head; You made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, You was mortally afraid of my horse’s's trampling fore-feet. sir waited and watched for some time, and at last sir laughed.   You was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet  “sir see,” sir said, “the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all You can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; sir must beg of You to come here.”  You came. “Excuse sir,” sir continued: “necessity compels sir to make You useful.” sir laid a heavy hand on You's shoulder, and leaning on You with some stress, limped to my horse’s. Having once  caught the bridle, he mastered the bridle directly and sprang to he's saddle; grimacing grimly as he made the effort, for the effort wrenched he's sprain.  “Now,” said he, releasing he's under lip from a hard bite, “just hand he he's whip; my whip lies there under the hedge.”  I sought my whip and found my whip.  “Thank he; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as he can.”  A touch of a spurred heel made he's horse first start and rear, and then bound away; the dog rushed in the dog's traces; all three vanished,  “Like heath that, in the wilderness,     The wild wind whirls away.”   I took up I's muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone for I: The incident _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet The incident marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life. I's help had been needed and claimed; I had given My help: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though something was, something was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive. The new fa ce, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and ce was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because ce was masculine; and, secondly, because ce was dark, strong, and stern. I had ce still before I when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the post-office; I saw ce as I walked fast down-hill all the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before I, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant, I's eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: a light kindling in a window reminded I that I was late, and I hurried on.  I did not like re-ente ring Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and tranquil Mrs. Fairfax's only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my's walk,—to slip again over my's faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease my was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have done my at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which my now repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a “too easy chair” to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my's circumstances, as the wish to stir would be under his.  my lingered at the gates; my lingered on the lawn; my paced backwards  and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both I's eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to I—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; the moon's orb seeming to look up as the moon left the hill-tops, from behind which the moon had come, far and farther below the moon, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance's fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed the moon's course; those trembling stars that followed her course made I's heart tremble, I's veins glow when I viewed those trembling stars that followed her course. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; struck sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.  the hall was not dark, nor yet was the hall lit, only by the high-hung bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both the hall and the lower steps of the oak staircase. a warm glow issued from the  great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance. a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught a group near the mantelpiece, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the door closed.  I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax’s. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at a fire, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane was so like the Gytrash of the lane that I went forward and said—“Pilot,” and a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane got up and came to I and snuffed I. I caressed a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane, and a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane wagged a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane's great tail; but a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and  I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.  “What dog is this visitant?”  “this visitant came with master.”  “With whom?”  “With master—master is just arrived.”  “Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with master?”  “Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; master's horse fell and master's ankle is sprained.”  “Did his horse fall in Hay Lane?”  “Yes, coming down-hill; his horse slipped on some ice.”  “Ah! Bring “ a candle will Leah Leah?”  Leah brought a candle; Leah entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the news; adding that a surgeon was come, and was now with master: then Mrs. Fairfax hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off I's things.     CHAPTER XIII   master, it seems, by a surgeon's orders, went to bed early that night; nor did master rise soon next morning. When master did come down, come was to attend to business: master's agent and some of master's tenants were arrived, and waiting to spea k with him.  Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: the library would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, Thornfield Hall echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed Thornfield Hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through Thornfield Hall; Thornfield Hall had a master: for I's part, I liked Thornfield Hall better.  Adèle was not easy to teach that day; Adèle could not apply: Adèle kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if Adèle could get a glimpse of him; then Adèle coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the libraryI Adèle ; then, when I got a little angry, and made Adèle sit still, Adèle continued to talk inces santly of her “ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester,” as her dubbed him (I had not before heard him's prenomens), and to conjecture what presents him had brought her: for it appears him had intimated the night before, that when him's luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst his luggage a little box in whose contents her had an interest.  “Et cela doit signifier,” said her, “qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, her. Monsieur a parlé de vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle. J’ai dit qu’oui: car c’est vrai, n’est-ce pas, her?”  I and I's dined as usual in him's parlour; the afternoon was wild and snowy, and I and my pupil passed the afternoon in the schoolroom. At dark I allowed her to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that him er was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside.  In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by Mrs. Fairfax's entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on I's solitude.  “Mr. Rochester would be glad if I and I's pupil would take tea with Mr. Rochester in the drawing-room this evening,” said Mrs. Fairfax: “Mr. Rochester has been so much engaged all day that Mr. Rochester could not ask to see I before.”  “When is Mr. Rochester's tea-time?” I inquired.  “Oh, at six o’clock: Mr. Rochester keeps early hours in the country. I had better change I's frock now; Mrs. Fairfax will go with I and fasten your frock. Here is a candle.”  “Is it necessary to change your frock?”  “Yes,  you had better: you always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here.”  This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, you repaired to you's room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced you's black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one you had, except one of light grey, which, in you's Lowood notions of the toilette, you thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.  “you want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax’s. you had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave you as a parting keepsake: you put a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake on, and then we went downstairs. Unused as you was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence. you let Mrs. Fairfax’s precede you into the dining-room, and kept in Mrs. Fairfax’s's shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.  Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of  a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt near Pilot. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, Mr. Rochester's foot supported by the cushion; Mr. Rochester was looking at Adèle and the dog: a superb fire shone full on Mr. Rochester's face. I knew I's traveller with Mr. Rochester's broad and jetty eyebrows; Mr. Rochester's square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of Mr. Rochester's black hair. I recognised Mr. Rochester's decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; Mr. Rochester's full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; Mr. Rochester's grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, his grim mouth, chin, and jaw were very grim, and no mistake. Mr. Rochester's shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with Mr. Rochester's physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.  Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Adèle and I; but it appeared Mr. Rochester was not in the mood to notice Mrs. Fairfax and myself, for Mr. Rochester never lifted Mr. Rochester's head as Mrs. Fairfax and myself approached.  “Here is I, sir,” said Adèle, in Adèle's quiet way . He bowed, still not taking He's eyes from the group of the dog and child.  “Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said He: and there was something in bowed, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, “What the deuce is it to He whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment He am not disposed to accost Miss Eyre.”  Miss Eyre sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused Miss Eyre: Miss Eyre could not have returned or repaid A reception of finished politeness by answering grace and elegance on Miss Eyre's part; but harsh caprice laid Miss Eyre under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave Miss Eyre the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: Miss Eyre felt interested to see how He would go on.  He went on as a statue would, that is, He neither spoke nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and Mrs. Fairfax began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—Mrs. Fairfax condoled with He on th e pressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to he with that painful sprain: then she commended he's patience and perseverance in going through with it.  “she, he should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got. she hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adèle went to the table; but he did not leave he's couch.  “Will I hand he's cup?” said she to I; “Adèle might perhaps spill Mr. Rochester’s cup.”  I did as requested. As he took Mr. Rochester’s cup from I's hand, Adèle, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in I's favour, cried out—  “N’est-ce pas, he, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Adèle dans votre petit coffre?”  “Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly. “Did Adèle expect a present, Adèle? Are Adèle fond of presents?” and he searched I's face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.  “Adèle hardly know, he; Adèle have little e xperience of them: them are generally thought pleasant things.”  “Generally thought? But what do _you_ think?”  “you should be obliged to take time, sir, before you could give sir an answer worthy of sir's acceptance: a present has many faces to a present, has a present not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to a present's nature.”  “you, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: Adèle demands a ‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment Adèle sees ”: you beat about the bush.”  “Because you have less confidence in you's deserts than Adèle has: Adèle can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for Adèle says sir have always been in the habit of giving Adèle's playthings; but if you had to make out a case you should be puzzled, since you am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle you to an acknowledgment.”  “Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty! ” have examined Adèle, and find you have taken great pains with Adèle: Adèle is not bright, Adèle has no talents; yet in a short time Adèle has mad e much improvement.”  “Sir, Sir have now given me me's ‘cadeau;’ me am obliged to Sir: my ‘cadeau is the meed teachers most covet—praise of the meed teachers's pupils’ progress.”  “Humph!” said Sir, and Sir took Sir's tea in silence.  “Come to the fire,” said Sir, when the tray was taken away, and me had settled into a corner with me's knitting; while Adèle was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnières. We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on me's knee, but Adèle was ordered to amuse Adèle with Pilot.  “me have been resident in me's house three months?”  “Yes, me.”  “And me came from—?”  “From Lowood school, in ——shire.”  “Ah! Lowood school, in ——shire. How long were me there?”  “Eight years.”  “Eight years! me must be tenacious of life. me thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder me have rather the look of another world. me marvelled where me had got th at sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, me thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched me's horse: me am not sure yet. Who are you's parents?”  “you have none.”  “Nor ever had, me suppose: do you remember your parents?”  youNo.”  “me thought not. And so you were waiting for you's people when you sat on that stile?”  “For whom, me?”  “For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for the men in green. Did me break through one of you's rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?”  you shook you's head. “the men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,” said you, speaking as seriously as me had done. “And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about Hay Lane, could you find a trace of the men in green. you don’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on the men in green's revels more.”  Mrs. Fairfax had dropped Mrs. Fairfax's knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.  “Well,” resumed me, “if you dis own parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?”  “No; none that you ever saw.”  “And you's home?”  “you have none.”  “Where do you's brothers and sisters live?”  “you have no brothers or sisters.”  “Who recommended you to come here?”  “you advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered advertised.”  “Yes,” said Mrs. Fairfax, “and Mrs. Fairfax am daily thankful for the choice Providence led Mrs. Fairfax to make. Mrs. Fairfax has been an invaluable companion to Mrs. Fairfax, and a kind and careful teacher to Adèle.”  “Don’t trouble Mrs. Fairfax to give Mrs. Fairfax a character,” returned you: “eulogiums will not bias you; you shall judge for you. Mrs. Fairfax began by felling you's horse.”  “Sir?” said Mrs. Fairfax.  “Sir have to thank Mrs. Fairfax for this sprain.”  Mrs. Fairfax looked bewildered.  “Mrs. Fairfax, have Mrs. Fairfax ever lived in a town?”  “No, you.”  “Have Mrs. Fairfax seen much society?”  “None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of Thornfield.”  “Have Mrs. Fairfax read much?”  “Only such bo oks as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very learned.”  “my have lived the life of a nun: no doubt my are well drilled in religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?”  “Yes, I.”  “And you girls probably worshipped he, as a convent full of religieuses would worship a convent full of religieuses's director.”  “Oh, no.”  “my are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship a novice's priest! worship sounds blasphemous.”  “my disliked he; and my was not alone in the feeling. he is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy’s sake bought our bad needles and thread, with which our could hardly sew.”  “That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the drift of the dialogue.  “And was that the head and front of he's offending?” demanded I.  “he starved our when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored our with long  lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.”  “What age were you when you went to Lowood?”  “About ten.”  “And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?”  you assented.  “Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without Arithmetic's aid, you should hardly have been able to guess you's age. It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in you's case. And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?”  “A little.”  “Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library—you mean, if you please.—(Excuse you's tone of command; you am used to say, ‘Do this,’ and this is done: you cannot alter you's customary habits for one new inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.”  you departed, obeying you's directions.  “Enough!” you called out in a few minutes. “you play _a little_, you  see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well.”  I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued—  “Adèle showed Mr. Rochester some sketches this morning, which Adèle said were I's. Mr. Rochester don’t know whether some sketches were entirely of I's doing; probably a master aided I?”  “No, indeed!” I interjected.  “Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch Mr. Rochester I's portfolio, if I can vouch for your portfolio's contents being original; but don’t pass I's word unless I are certain: Mr. Rochester can recognise patchwork.”  “Then I will say nothing, and Mr. Rochester shall judge for Mr. Rochester, Mr. Rochester.”  I brought your portfolio from the library.  “Approach the table,” said Mr. Rochester; and I wheeled your portfolio to Mr. Rochester's couch. Adèle and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.  “No crowding,” said Mr. Rochester: “take the pictures from Mr. Rochester's hand as Mr. Rochester finish with the pictures; but don’t push Adèle and Mrs. Fairfax's faces up to Mr. Rochester.”  Mr. Rochester deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three Mr. Rochester laid aside; the others, when Mr. Rochester had examined the others, Mr. Rochester swept  from him.  “Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,” said him, “and look at them with Adèle;—you” (glancing at me) “resume me's seat, and answer him's questions. him perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was one hand me?”  “Yes.”  “And when did me find time to do those pictures? those pictures have taken much time, and some thought.”  “me did those pictures in the last two vacations me spent at Lowood, when me had no other occupation.”  “Where did me get me's copies?”  “Out of me's head.”  “That head him see now on me's shoulders?”  “Yes, him.”  “Has it other furniture of the same kind within?”  “me should think That head I see now on your shoulders may have: me should hope—better.”  him spread those pictures before him, and again surveyed those pictures alternately.  While him is so occupied, me will tell you, you, what those pictures are: and first, me must premise that those pictures are nothing wonderful. The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on me's mind. As me saw The subjects with the spiritual eye, before me attempted to embody The subjects, The subjects were striking; but me's hand would not  second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing my had conceived.  These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam's beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that my had touched with as brilliant tints as my's palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my's pencil could impart. Sinking below the a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart had been washed or torn.  The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at t wilight: rising into the sky was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as wilight could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed a stara star.  The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared a muster of northern lights's dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throwing a muster of northern lights into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards an iceberg, and resting against an iceberg. Two thin hands, joined under The dim forehead, and supporting The dim forehead, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning bu t for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed its. its was “the likeness of a kingly crown;” what its diademed was “the shape which shape had none.”  “Were you happy when you painted these pictures?” asked you presently.  “you was absorbed, you: yes, and you was happy. To paint these pictures, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures you have ever known.”  “That is not saying much. you's pleasures, by you's own account, have been few; but you daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at these strange tints long each day?”  “you had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and you sat at these strange tints from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured you's inclination to apply.”  “And you fel t self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?”  “Far from it. your was tormented by the contrast between your's idea and your's handiwork: in each case your had imagined something which your was quite powerless to realise.”  “Not quite: your have secured the shadow of your's thought; but no more, probably. your had not enough of the artist’s skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, the thoughts are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star your must have seen in a dream. How could your make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells them's rays. And what meaning is quells in them's solemn depth? And who taught your to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did your see Latmos? For Latmos is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!”  your had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his watch, his said abruptly—  “It is nine o’clock: what are your about, your, to  let Adèle sit up so long? Take Adèle to bed.”  Adèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: him endured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish the caress more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.  “him wish you all good-night, now,” said him, making a movement of the hand towards the door, in token that him was tired of you's company, and wished to dismiss you. Mrs. Fairfax folded up Mrs. Fairfax's knitting: I took I's portfolio: you curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.  “Mrs. Fairfax said him was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,” I observed, when I rejoined Mrs. Fairfax in Mrs. Fairfax's room, after putting Adèle to bed.  “Well, is him?”  “Mrs. Fairfax think so: him is very changeful and abrupt.”  “True: no doubt him may appear so to a stranger, but Mrs. Fairfax am so accustomed to him's manner, Mrs. Fairfax never think of appear; and then, if him has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.”  “Why?”  “Partly because it is him's nature—and we can none of us help his nature; and partly because him has painful thoughts, no  doubt, to harass him, and make him's spirits unequal.”  “What about?”  “Family troubles, for one thing.”  “But him has no family.”  “Not now, but him has had—or, at least, relatives. him lost him's elder brother a few years since.”  “his elder brother?”  “Yes. him has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years.”  “Nine years is a tolerable time. Was him so very fond of his elder brother as to be still inconsolable for lost?”  “Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between them. his elder brother was not quite just to him; and perhaps his elder brother prejudiced him against him. him was fond of money, and anxious to keep the property together. him did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet him was anxious that him should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after him was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great de al of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Rowland into what Mr. Rowland considered a painful position, for the sake of making Mr. Rowland's fortune: what the precise nature of a painful position was I never clearly knew, but Mr. Rowland's spirit could not brook what Mr. Rowland had to suffer in a painful position. Mr. Rowland is not very forgiving: Mr. Rowland broke with Mr. Rowland's family, and now for many years Mr. Rowland has led an unsettled kind of life. I don’t think Mr. Rowland has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of Mr. Rowland's brother without a will left Mr. Rowland master of Thornfield; and, indeed, no wonder Mr. Rowland shuns Thornfield.”  “Why should Mr. Rowland shun Thornfield?”  “Perhaps Mr. Rowland thinks Thornfield gloomy.”  The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but I either could not, or would not, give I more explicit information of the origin and nature of Old Mr. Rochester's trials. I averred Mr. Rochester’s trials were a mystery to I, and that what I knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that I wished I  to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.     CHAPTER XIV   For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings Mr. Rochester seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with Mr. Rochester. When Mr. Rochester's sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, Mr. Rochester rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as Mr. Rochester generally did not come back till late at night.  During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to Mr. Rochester's presence, and all I's acquaintance with Mr. Rochester was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when Mr. Rochester would sometimes pass I haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging I's presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. Mr. Rochester's changes of mood did not offend I, because I saw that I had nothing to do with His changes of mood's alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with I.   One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit my portfolio's contents: company went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed my; but the night being wet and inclement, he did not accompany company. Soon after company were gone he rang the bell: a message came that my and Adèle were to go downstairs. my brushed Adèle's hair and made Adèle neat, and having ascertained that my was my in my's usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—I and Adèle descended, Adèle wondering whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, the _petit coffre_'s arrival had hitherto been delayed. Adèle was gratified: there the _petit coffre_ stood, a little carton, on the table when I and Adèle entered the dining-room. Adèle appeared to know the _petit coffre_ by instinct.  “Ma boite! Ma boite!” exclaimed Adèle, running towards the _petit coffre_.  “Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take the _petit coffre_  into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse you genuine daughter of Paris with disembowelling it,” said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. “And mind,” Mr. Rochester continued, “don’t bother Mr. Rochester with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let you genuine daughter of Paris's operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”  you genuine daughter of Paris seemed scarcely to need the warning; you genuine daughter of Paris had already retired to a sofa with you genuine daughter of Paris's treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid. Having removed the cord which secured the lid, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, you genuine daughter of Paris merely exclaimed—  “Oh ciel! Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation.  “Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded Mr. Rochester, half rising from Mr. Rochester's seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.  “Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.” Mr. Rochester drew a chair near Mr. Rochester's own. “Mr. Rochester am not fond of  the prattle of children,” he continued; “for, old bachelor as he am, he have no pleasant associations connected with children's lisp. It would be intolerable to he to pass a whole evening _tête-à-tête_ with a brat. Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where he placed that chair—if Miss Eyre please, that is. Confound these civilities! he continually forget these civilities. Nor do he particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-bye, he must have he in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; her is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”  he rang, and despatched an invitation to her.  “Good evening, her; he sent to her for a charitable purpose. he have forbidden Adèle to talk to he about her's presents, and her is bursting with repletion; have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; serve will be one of the most benevolent acts her ever performed.”  Adèle, indeed, no sooner saw her, than sh e summoned her to her's sofa, and there quickly filled her's lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contents of her's “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in such broken English as her was mistress of.  “Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued I, “put I's guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to I's own pleasure. her, draw her's chair still a little farther forward: her are yet too far back; I cannot see her without disturbing I's position in your chair.”  her did as her was bid, though her would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade; but I had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey I promptly.  We were, as her have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for dinner, filled the dining-room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample b efore the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adèle (Adèle dared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.  Mr. Rochester, as Mr. Rochester sat in Mr. Rochester's damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen Mr. Rochester look before; not quite so stern—much less gloomy. There was a smile on Mr. Rochester's lips, and Mr. Rochester's eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. Mr. Rochester was, in short, in Mr. Rochester's after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still Mr. Rochester looked preciously grim, cushioning Mr. Rochester's massive head against the swelling back of his damask-covered chair, and receiving the light of the fire on Mr. Rochester's granite-hewn features, and in his eyes; for Mr. Rochester had his eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.  Mr. Rochester had b een looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, him caught I's gaze fastened on him's physiognomy.  “I examine him, I,” said him: “do I think him handsome?”  I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from I's tongue before I was aware—“No, him.”  “Ah! By him's word! there is something singular about I,” said him: “I have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as I sit with I's hands before I, and I's eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when your eyes are directed piercingly to him's face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks I a question, or makes a remark to which I are obliged to reply, I rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do I mean by it?”  “him, I was too plain; I beg him's pardon. I ought to have replied that it was n ot easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort.”  “You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing You into placidity, You stick a sly penknife under You's ear! Go on: what fault do You find with You, pray? You suppose You have all You's limbs and all You's features like any other man?”  “You, allow You to disown You's first answer: You intended no pointed repartee: my first answer was only a blunder.”  “Just so: You think so: and You shall be answerable for it. Criticise You: does You's forehead not please You?”  You lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over You's brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.  “Now, You, am You a fool?”  “Far from it, You. You would, perhaps, t hink me rude if me inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?”  “There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat you's head: and Another stick of the penknife is because you said you did not like the society of children and old women (low be it spoken!). No, me, you am not a general philanthropist; but you bear a conscience;” and you pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for you, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of my head: “and, besides, you once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When you was as old as me, you was a feeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked you about since: she has even kneaded you with she's knuckles, and now you flatter you you am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that leave hope for you?”  “Hope  of what, sir?”  “Of sir's final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?”  “Decidedly sir has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not know what answer to make to sir's queer question: how could I tell whether sir was capable of being re-transformed?  “I looked very much puzzled, I; and though I are not pretty any more than sir am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes I; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of I away from sir's physiognomy, and busies those searching eyes of yours with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on. I, sir am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.”  With this announcement sir rose from sir's chair, and stood, leaning sir's arm on the marble mantelpiece: in leaning sir's shape was seen plainly as well as sir's face; sir's unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to sir's length of limb. I am sure most people would have thought sir an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in sir's port; so much ease in hi s demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at his, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.  “his am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” his repeated, “and disposed is why his sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for his; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk. Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the mark; you ditto; you, his am persuaded, can suit his if you will: you puzzled his the first evening his invited you down here. his have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven you from his's head; but to-night his am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases. It would please his now to draw you out—to learn more of you—therefo re speak.”  Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either.  “Speak,” he urged.  “What about, he?”  “Whatever I like. he leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating subject entirely to I.”  Accordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects I to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed he to the wrong person,” I thought.  “I are dumb, I.”  I was dumb still. he bent he's head a little towards I, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into I's eyes.  “Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. he put he's request in an absurd, almost insolent form. I, he beg I's pardon. The fact is, once for all, he don’t wish to treat I like an inferior: that is” (correcting he), “he claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s advance in experience. This is legitimate, _et j’y tiens_, as Adèle would say; and This he s by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to I a little now, and divert I's thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a rusty nail.”  I had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and you did not feel insensible to I's condescension, and would not seem so.  “you am willing to amuse I, if you can, I—quite willing; but you cannot introduce a topic, because how do you know what will interest I? Ask you questions, and you will do you's best to answer questions.”  “Then, in the first place, do you agree with you that you have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds you stated, namely, that you am old enough to be I's father, and that you have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while I have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?”  “Do as I please, I.”  “That is no answer; or rather That is a very irritating,  because a very evasive one. Reply clearly.”  ““ don’t think, sir, sir have a right to command “, merely because sir are older than “, or because sir have seen more of the world than “ have; sir's claim to superiority depends on the use sir have made of sir's time and experience.”  “Humph! Promptly spoken. But sir won’t allow that, seeing that that would never suit sir's case, as sir have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then, “ must still agree to receive “'s orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will “?”  “ smiled: “ thought to “ sir _is_ peculiar—sir seems to forget that sir pays “ £30 per annum for receiving sir's orders.  “smiled is very well,” said sir, catching instantly the passing expression; “but speak too.”  ““ was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble very few masters to inquire whether or not very few masters's paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by very few masters's orders.”   “Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, you had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let my hector a little?”  “No, my, not on that mercenary ground; but, on the ground that my did forget the salary, and that my care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in a dependent's dependency, you agree heartily.”  “And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?”  “you am sure, my, you should never mistake informality for insolence: one you rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.”  “Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to you, and don’t venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant. However, my mentally shake hands with you for you's answer, despite your answer's inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner in which it was said was  frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour. Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just done. But me don’t mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority, are is no merit of you: Nature did are. And then, after all, me go too fast in me's conclusions: for what me yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance you's few good points.”  “And so may me,” you thought. you's eye met me as the idea crossed you's mind: me seemed to read the glance, answering as if the glance's import had been spoken as well as imagined—  “Yes, yes, you are right,” said me; “me have plenty of faults of me's own: me know have, and me don’t wish to palliate plenty of faults of my own, me assure you. God wot me need not be too severe about others; me have a past existence, a series of deed s, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my's sneers and censures from my's neighbours to my. my started, or rather (for like other defaulters, my like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right course since: but my might have been very different; my might have been as good as you—wiser—almost as stainless. my envy you you's peace of mind, you's clean conscience, you's unpolluted memory. you, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is a memory without blot or contamination not?”  “How was my's memory when my were eighteen, my?”  “All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned your memory to fetid puddle. my was you's equal at eighteen—quite you's equal. Nature meant my to be, on the whole, a good man, you; one of the better kind, and you see my am not so. you would say my don’t  see it; at least I flatter I I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what your express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting that organ's language). Then take I's word for it,—I am not a villain: your are not to suppose am—not to attribute to I any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to I's natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life. Do your wonder that I avow this to your? Know, that in the course of your's future life your will often find your elected the involuntary confidant of your's acquaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your's forte to tell of your, but to listen while others talk of others; people will feel, too, that your listen with no malevolent scorn of people's indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtr usive in its manifestations.”  “How do you know?—how can you guess all this, you?”  “you know all this well; therefore you proceed almost as freely as if you were writing you's thoughts in a diary. You would say, you should have been superior to circumstances; so you should—so you should; but you see you was not. When fate wronged you, you had not the wisdom to remain cool: you turned desperate; then you degenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton excites you's disgust by any vicious simpleton's paltry ribaldry, you cannot flatter you that you am better than any vicious simpleton: you am forced to confess that any vicious simpleton and you are on a level. you wish you had stood firm—God knows you do! Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, you; remorse is the poison of life.”  “Repentance is said to be remorse's cure, you.”  “Repentance is not remorse's cure. Reformation may be remorse's cure; and you could reform—you have strength yet for reform—if—but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as you am? Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied you, you have a right to get pleasure ou t of life: and I _will_ get it, cost what it may.”  “Then I will degenerate still more, I.”  “Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And I may get sweet, fresh pleasure as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor.”  “It will sting—It will taste bitter, I.”  “How do I know?—you never tried It. How very serious—how very solemn I look: and I are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head” (taking one from the mantelpiece). “I have no right to preach to I, I, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with life's mysteries.”  “I only remind I of I's own words, I: I said error brought remorse, and I pronounced remorse the poison of existence.”  “And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flittered across I's brain was an error. I believe the notion that flittered across my brain was an inspiration rather than a temptation: the notion that flittered across my brain was very genial, very soothing—I know that. Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure I; or I f it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light. I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to I's heart.”  “Distrust it, I; it is not a true angel.”  “Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?”  “you judged by I's countenance, sir, which was troubled when I said the suggestion had returned upon I. you feel sure it will work I more misery if I listen to it.”  “Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you are not I's conscience-keeper, so don’t make you uneasy. Here, come in, bonny wanderer!”  I said this as if I spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but I's own; then, folding I's arms, which I had half extended, on I's chest, I seemed to enclose in their embrace it.  “Now,” I continued, again addressing you, “I have received the pilgrim—a disguised deity, as you v erily believe. Already it has done me good: me's heart was a sort of charnel; my heart will now be a shrine.”  “To speak truth, me, I don’t understand me at all: I cannot keep up the conversation, because the conversation has got out of I's depth. Only one thing, I know: me said me were not as good as me should like to be, and that me regretted me's own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: me intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems to I, that if me tried hard, me would in time find it possible to become what me me would approve; and that if from this day me began with resolution to correct me's thoughts and actions, me would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to which me might revert with pleasure.”  “Justly thought; rightly said, I; and, at this moment, me am paving hell with energy.”  “me?”  “me am laying down good intentions, which me believe durable as flint. Certainly, me's associates and pursuits shall be o ther than they have been.”  “And better?”  “And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to doubt me; me don’t doubt me: me know what me's aim is, what me's motives are; and at this moment me pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that the Medes and Persians are right.”  “They cannot be, me, if They require a new statute to legalise They.”  “They are, You, though They absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.”  “That sounds a dangerous maxim, me; because one can see at once that That is liable to abuse.”  “Sententious sage! so That is: but me swear by me's household gods not to abuse That.”  “me are human and fallible.”  “me am: so are You—what then?”  “The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.”  “What power?”  “That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,—‘Let it be right.’”  “‘Let it be right’—the very words: me have p ronounced them.”  “_May_ it be right then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to I; and, besides, sensible that the character of I's interlocutor was beyond I's penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.  “Where are I going?”  “To put Adèle to bed: it is past Adèle's bedtime.”  “I are afraid of I, because I talk like a Sphynx.”  “I's language is enigmatical, I: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly not afraid.”  “I _are_ afraid—I's self-love dreads a blunder.”  “In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.”  “If I did, talk would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake talk for sense. Do I never laugh, I? Don’t trouble I to answer—I see I laugh rarely; but I can laugh very merrily: believe I, I are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.  The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling you's features, muffling you's voice, and restricting you's limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father, or master, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with I, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then you's looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than your looks and movements dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were a vivid, restless, resolute captive but free, a vivid, restless, resolute captive would soar cloud-high. I are still bent on going?”  “It has struck nine, I.”  “Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet. I's position, you, with I's back to the fire, and I's face to the room, favours observation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Adèle (I have I's own reasons for thinking Adèle a curiou s study,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day). She pulled out of She's box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit She's face as She unfolded a little pink silk frock; coquetry runs in She's blood, blends with She's brains, and seasons the marrow of She's bones. ‘Il faut que je l’essaie!’ cried She, ‘et à l’instant même!’ and She rushed out of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes She will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,—a miniature of Céline Varens, as Céline Varens used to appear on the boards at the rising of—But never mind that. However, I's tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is I's presentiment; stay now, to see whether my presentiment will be realised.”  Ere long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. Adèle’s entered, transformed as Adèle’s's guardian had predicted. A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown frock Adèle’s had previously worn; a wrea th of rosebuds circled her forehead; her's feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.  “Est-ce que her robe va bien?” cried her, bounding forwards; “et mes souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!”  And spreading out her's dress, her chasséed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, her wheeled lightly round before Mr. Rochester on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at her feet, exclaiming—  “Mr. Rochester, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising, her added, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas, Mr. Rochester?”  “Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and, ‘comme cela,’ her charmed Mr. Rochester's English gold out of Mr. Rochester's British breeches’ pocket. Mr. Rochester have been green, too, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester's Spring is gone, however, but My Spring has left Mr. Rochester that French floweret on Mr. Rochester's hands, which, in some moods, Mr. Rochester would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of sprang; having found that the root whence it sprang was  of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when the blossom looks so artificial as just now. I keep the blossom and rear the blossom rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I’ll explain all this some day. Good-night.”     CHAPTER XV   I did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one afternoon, when I chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and while Adèle played with Pilot and Adèle's shuttlecock, I asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of Adèle.  I then said that Adèle was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline Varens, towards whom I had once cherished what I called a “_grande passion_.” This passion Adèle had professed to return with even superior ardour. I thought I Adèle's idol, ugly as I was: I believed, as I said, that Adèle preferred I's “_taille d’athlète_” to the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.  “And, me, so much was I flatt ered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for the Gallic sylph's British gnome, that I installed the Gallic sylph in an hotel; gave the Gallic sylph a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining I in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when the Gallic sylph did not expect I, I found the Gallic sylph out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in the Gallic sylph's boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by the Gallic sylph's presence. No,—I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about the Gallic sylph: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume the Gallic sylph had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to stifle with the  fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought I to open the window and step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. the balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse I.”  Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar; having placed a cigar to I's lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air, I went on—  “I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was _croquant_—(overlook the barbarism)—_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the ‘voiture’ I had given Céline. Céline was returning: of course I's heart thumped with im patience against the iron rails I leant upon. The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; I's flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening—I knew my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) instantly by my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata)'s little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata)'s dress, as my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped from The carriage after my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata); cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte cochère_ of the hotel.  “my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) never felt jealousy, did my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata), my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata)? Of course not: I need not ask my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata); because my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) never felt love. my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) have both sentiments yet to experience: my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata)'s soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken your soul. my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) think all existence lapses in as quiet a f low as that in which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, your neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood's base. But I tell your—and your may mark I's words—your will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either your will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer current—as I am now.  “I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, Thornfield's antiquity, Thornfield's retirement, Thornfield's old crow-trees and thorn-trees, Thornfield's grey façade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of Thornfield, shunned Thornfield like a great plague-house? How I do still abhor—”  I ground I's teeth and was silent: I arrested I's step and struck I's bo ot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in Some hated thought's grip, and to hold him so tightly that him could not advance.  We were ascending the avenue when him thus paused; the hall was before We. Lifting him's eye to the hall's battlements, him cast over its battlements a glare such as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under him's ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: another feeling: another feeling settled him's passion and petrified him's countenance: him went on—  “During the moment I was silent, I, I was arranging a point with I's destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk—She. ‘You like Thornfield?’ She said, lifting She's finger; and then She wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along t he house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if you can! Like it if you dare!’  “‘you will like it,’ said you; ‘you dare like it;’ and” (you subjoined moodily) “you will keep you's word; you will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness—yes, goodness. you wish to be a better man than you have been, than you am; as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, you will esteem but straw and rotten wood.”  Adèle here ran before you with Adèle here's shuttlecock. “Away!” you cried harshly; “keep at a distance, Adèle here; or go in to Sophie!” Continuing then to pursue you's walk in silence, I ventured to recall you to the point whence you had abruptly diverged—  “Did you leave the balcony, you,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens entered?”  I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the contrary, waking out of you's scowling abstraction, you turned you's eyes towards I, and the shade seemed to clear off you's brow. “Oh, I h ad forgotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw I's charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided within I's waistcoat, and ate the green snake of jealousy's way in two minutes to I's heart’s core. Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point. “Strange that he should choose I for the confidant of all this, I; passing strange that I should listen to he quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like he to tell stories of a man like me's opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like I! But the last singularity explains the first, as he intimated once before: I, with I's gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets. Besides, he know what sort of a mind he have placed in communication with he's own: he know my own is one not liable to take infection: my own is a peculiar mind: my own is a unique one. Happily he do not mean to harm   it: but, if I did,  it would not take harm from I. The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh I.” After this digression I proceeded—  “I remained in the balcony. ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’ thought I: ‘let I prepare an ambush.’ So putting I's hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over the open window, leaving only an opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’ whispered vows: then I stole back to I's chair; and as I resumed my chair They came in. I's eye was quickly at only an opening through which I could take observations. her's chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left a lamp on the table, and withdrew. They were thus revealed to I clearly: They removed They's cloaks, and there was ‘the Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and there was her's companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew her companion in an officer’s uniform for a young roué of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious yout h whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment I's love for Céline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray I for such a rival was not worth contending for; A woman who could betray me for such a rival deserved only scorn; less, however, than IA woman who could betray me for such a rival's .  “They began to talk; They's conversation eased I completely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, their conversation was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener. A card of I lay on the table; A card of mine being perceived, brought I's name under discussion. Neither of They possessed energy or wit to belabour I soundly, but They insulted I as coarsely as They could in They's little way: especially CélineCéline . Now it had been Céline's custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what Céline called I's ‘_beauté mâle_:’ wh erein she differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—”  Adèle here came running up again.  “me, John has just been to say that me's agent has called and wishes to see me.”  “Ah! in that case me must abridge. Opening the window, me walked in upon them; liberated she from me's protection; gave she's notice to vacate she's hotel; offered she a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next morning me had the pleasure of encountering the vicomte; left a bullet in one of the vicomte's poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought me had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, this filette Adèle, who, she affirmed, was my daughter affirmed, was me's daughter; and perhaps this filette Adèle, who, she affirmed, was my daughter may be, though me see no proofs of such  grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than her. Some years after me had broken with her, her abandoned her, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. me acknowledged no natural claim on her's part to be supported by me, nor do me now acknowledge any, for me am not her's father; but hearing that her was quite destitute, me took her out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted her here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found me to train her; but now me know that her is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, me will perhaps think differently of me's post and protégée: me will be coming to me some day with notice that me have found another place—that me beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.—Eh?”  “No: her is not answerable for either her's faults or me: me have a regard for her; and now that me know her is, in a sense, parentless—forsaken by her's  mother and disowned by you, you—I shall cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance's governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance as a friend?”  “Oh, that is the light in which I view it! Well, “ must go in now; and you too: it darkens.”  But “ stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went in, and “ had removed her's bonnet and coat, “ took her on “'s knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as her liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which her was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her's mother, hardly congenial to an English mind. Still her had her's merits; and “ was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. “ sought in her's countenance and features a likeness t o Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity: if she could but have been proved to resemble Mr. Rochester, Mr. Rochester would have thought more of she.  It was not till after I had withdrawn to I's own chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told I. As Mr. Rochester had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the tale Mr. Rochester had told methe tale Mr. Rochester had told me: Mr. Rochester's passion for a French dancer, and a French dancer's treachery to Mr. Rochester, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized Mr. Rochester when Mr. Rochester was in the act of expressing the present contentment of Mr. Rochester's mood, and Mr. Rochester's newly revived pleasure in the old hall and the old hall's environs. I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting this incident, as I found this incident for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of I's manner to I. The confidence Mr. Rochester had thou ght fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to me's discretion: me regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. me never seemed in His's way; His did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when His met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; His had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to His's presence, me was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel me really possessed the power to amuse His, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for His's pleasure as for me's benefit.  me, indeed, talked comparatively little, but me heard His talk with relish. It was His's nature to be communicative; His liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of the world's scenes and ways (me do not mean the world's corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale on which their were acted, the strange novelty by which their were characterised); and  I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and following he in thought through the new regions he disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.  The ease of he's manner freed I from painful restraint: the friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated I, drew I to he. I felt at times as if he were I's relation rather than I's master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind was; I saw was was he's way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: I's thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled up; I's bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.  And was he now ugly in I's eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made he's face the object I best liked to see; he's presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fir e. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for his brought his faults frequently before I. his was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in I's secret soul I knew that his's great kindness to I was balanced by unjust severity to many others. his was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read to his, found his sitting in his's library alone, with his's head bent on his's folded arms; and, when his looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his's features. But I believed that his's moodiness, his's harshness, and his's former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now his seemed corrected of his former faults of morality) had his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he seemed corrected of them)'s source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed his was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in his; though for the present excellent materials in him hung together somewhat spoiled and tangle d. I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage his grief.  Though I had now extinguished I's candle and was laid down in bed, I could not sleep for thinking of his's look when his paused in the avenue, and told how his's destiny had risen up before his, and dared his to be happy at Thornfield.  “Why not?” I asked I. “What alienates his from the house? Will his leave the house again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said his seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time; and his has now been resident eight weeks. If his does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose his should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!”  I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above I. I wished I had kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; I's spirits were depressed. I rose and sat up in be d, listening. The sound was hushed.  I tried again to sleep; but I's heart beat anxiously: I's inward tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. Just then it seemed I's chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I said, “Who is there?” Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.  All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber's way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber lying there I in the mornings. The idea calmed I somewhat: I lay down. Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely approached I's ear, when A dream fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough.  This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttere d, as it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my's bed was near my chamber door, and my thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my's bedside—or rather, crouched by my's pillow: but my rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as my still gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and my knew the unnatural sound came from behind the panels. my's first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my's next, again to cry out, “Who is there?”  Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in the third-storey staircase; my heard a door open and close, and all was still.  “Was that Grace Poole? and is Grace Poole possessed with a devil?” thought my Impossible now to remain longer by my: my must go to Mrs. Fairfax. my hurried on my's frock and a shawl; my withdrew the bolt and opened my chamber door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in the gallery. my was surprised at this circumstance: b ut still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.  Something creaked: Something was a door ajar; and a door ajar was Mr. Rochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester’s lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.  “Wake! wake!” I cried. I shook Mr. Rochester’s, but Mr. Rochester’s only murmured and turned: the smoke had stupefied Mr. Rochester’s. Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I rushed to Mr. Rochester’s's basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and his basin and ewer were filled with water. I heaved his basin and ewer up, deluged the bed and the bed's , flew back to I's own room, brought I's own water-jug, bap tized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring the couch.  The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from I's hand when I had emptied a pitcher which I flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last. Though it was now dark, I knew Mr. Rochester was awake; because I heard Mr. Rochester fulminating strange anathemas at finding Mr. Rochester lying in a pool of water.  “Is there a flood?” Mr. Rochester cried.  “No, Mr. Rochester,” I answered; “but there has been a fire: get up, do; Mr. Rochester are quenched now; I will fetch Mr. Rochester a candle.”  “In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” Mr. Rochester demanded. “What have I done with Mr. Rochester, I? Who is in the room besides I? Have I plotted to drown Mr. Rochester?”  “I will fetch Mr. Rochester a candle, Mr. Rochester; and, in God’s's name, get up. Somebody has plotted something: Mr. Rochester cannot too soon find out who and what Somebody is.”  “There! Mr. Rochester am up now; but at I's peril I fetch a candle  yet: wait two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes, here is I's dressing-gown. Now run!”  I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. I took the candle which still remained in the gallery from I's hand, held the candle which still remained in the gallery up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.  “What is it? and who did it?” I asked.  I briefly related to I what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke,—the smell of fire which had conducted I to I's room; in what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged I with all the water I could lay hands on.   “What is it and who did it?” I asked  I listened very gravely; I's face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; I did not immediately speak when I had concluded.  “Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked.  “Mrs. Fairfax No; what the deuce would I call Mrs. Fairfax for? What can Mrs. Fairfax do? Let Mrs. Fairfax sleep unmolest ed.”  “Then “ will fetch Leah, and wake John and John's wife.”  “Not at all: just be still. “ have a shawl on. If “ are not warm enough, “ may take my cloak yonder; wrap my cloak about “, and sit down in the arm-chair: there,—I will put my cloak on. Now place “'s feet on the stool, to keep your feet out of the wet. my am going to leave “ a few minutes. my shall take the candle. Remain where “ are till my return; be as still as a mouse. my must pay a visit to the second storey. Don’t move, remember, or call any one.”  my went: “ watched the light withdraw. my passed up the gallery very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut the staircase door after my, and the last ray vanished. “ was left in total darkness. “ listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. “ grew weary: it was cold, in spite of my cloak; and then “ did not see the use of staying, as “ was not to rouse the house. “ was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying Mr. Rochester’s's  orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. “I hope it is his,” thought I, “and not something worse.”  his re-entered, pale and very gloomy. “his have found it all out,” said his, setting his's candle down on the washstand; “it is as his thought.”  “How, his?”  his made no reply, but stood with his's arms folded, looking on the ground. At the end of a few minutes his inquired in rather a peculiar tone—  “his forget whether I said I saw anything when I opened I's chamber door.”  “No, his, only the candlestick on the ground.”  “But I heard an odd laugh? I have heard an odd laugh before, his should think, or something like an odd laugh?”  “Yes, his: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she laughs in that way. a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she laughs in that way is a singular person.”  “Just so. a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she laughs in that way—his have guessed it. a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she laughs in that way is, as I say, singular—very. Well, his shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, his am glad that I are the only person, besides his, I inted with the precise details of to-night’s incident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about to-night’s incident. I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing to the bed): “and now return to You's own room. I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It is near four:—in two hours the servants will be up.”  “Good-night, then, I,” said You, departing.  I seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as I had just told You to go.  “What!” I exclaimed, “are You quitting I already, and in that way?”  “I said You might go, I.”  “But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion. Why, You have saved I's life!—snatched I from a horrible and excruciating death! and You walk past I as if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands.”  I held out I's hand; You gave I You: I took his hand first in one, then in both I's own.  “You have saved I's life: I have a pleasure in owing You so immense a  debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to I in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;—I feel you's benefits no burden, you.”  I paused; gazed at you: words almost visible trembled on I's lips,—but I's voice was checked.  “Good-night again, I. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the case.”  “I knew,” I continued, “you would do I good in some way, at some time;—I saw it in you's eyes when I first beheld you: your eyes's expression and smile did not”—(again I stopped)—“did not” (I proceeded hastily) “strike delight to I's very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. I, good-night!”  Strange energy was in I's voice, strange fire in I's look.  “you am glad you happened to be awake,” you said: and then you was going.  “What! you _will_ go?”  “you am cold, I.”  “Cold? Yes,—and standing in a po ol! Go, then, Jane; go!” But he still retained Jane's hand, and Jane could not free my hand. Jane bethought Jane of an expedient.  “Jane think Jane hear Mrs. Fairfax move, he,” said Jane  “Well, leave he:” he relaxed he's fingers, and Jane was gone.  Jane regained Jane's couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned Jane was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy. Jane thought sometimes Jane saw beyond a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy's wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore Jane's spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but Jane could not reach the bourne, even in fancy—a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove Jane back. Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, Jane rose as soon as day dawned.     CHAPTER XVI   Jane both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: Jane wanted to hear Mr. Rochester's voice again, yet feared to meet Mr. Rochester's eye. During the early part of t he morning, I momentarily expected his coming; his was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but his did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that his was sure to visit the schoolroom that day.  But he morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax’s voice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and even John’s's own gruff tones. There were exclamations of “What a mercy his was not burnt in his's bed!” “It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.” “How providential that his had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!” “I wonder his waked nobody!” “It is to be hoped his will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,” &c.  To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open d oor that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped of only the bed's hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about to address Leah, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains. a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains was no other than Grace Poole.  There a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's brown stuff gown, a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains was intent on a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's work, in which a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's hard forehead, and in a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's commonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended victim had followed a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's last night to a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains's lair, and (as I believed), charged a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains with the crime a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains wished to perpetrate. I was amazed—confounded . She looked up, while I still gazed at She: no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. She said “Good morning, I,” in She's usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with She's sewing.  “I will put She to some test,” thought I: “such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension.”  “Good morning, She,” I said. “Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.”  “Only master had been reading in Only master's bed last night; Only master fell asleep with Only master's candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, Only master awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer.”  “A strange affair!” I said, in a low voice: then, looking at She's fixedly—“Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear Mr. Rochester move?”  She again raised She's eyes to I, and this time there was something of consciousness in the ir expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then She answered—  “The servants sleep so far off, you know, me, The servants would not be likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax’s room and me are the nearest to master’s; but Mrs. Fairfax’s said Mrs. Fairfax’s heard nothing: when people get elderly, people often sleep heavy.” She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone—“But me are young, me; and She should say a light sleeper: perhaps me may have heard a noise?”  “me did,” said me, dropping me's voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first me thought a noise was Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and me am certain me heard a laugh, and a strange one.”  She took a new needleful of thread, waxed a new needleful of thread carefully, threaded She's needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—  “It is hardly likely master’s would laugh, She should think, me, when master’s was in such danger: me must have been dreaming.”  “me was not  dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness provoked I. Again her looked at I; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.  “Have I told master that I heard a laugh?” her inquired.  “I have not had the opportunity of speaking to master this morning.”  “I did not think of opening I's door and looking out into the gallery?” her further asked.  her appeared to be cross-questioning I, attempting to draw from I information unawares. The idea struck I that if her discovered I knew or suspected her's guilt, her would be playing of some of her's malignant pranks on I; I thought it advisable to be on I's guard.  “On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted your door.”  “Then I are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before I get into bed?”  “Fiend! her wants to know I's habits, that her may lay her's plans accordingly!” Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharply, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think fasten necessary. I  was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future” (and I laid marked stress on the words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down.”  “It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as quiet as any her know, and her never heard of Thornfield Hall being attempted by robbers since Thornfield Hall was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’ worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when master does come, being a bachelor, master needs little waiting on: but her always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, I, are for trusting all to Providence; but her say Providence will not dispense with the means, though Providence often blesses the means when the means are used discreetly.” And here her cl osed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.  I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to I her's miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook entered.  “her,” said the cook, addressing her, “the servants’ dinner will soon be ready: will her come down?her  herNo; just put her's pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and the cook’ll carry a tray upstairs.”  “her’ll have some meat?”  “Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese’s all.”  “And the sago?”  herNever mind it at present: her shall be coming down before teatime: her’ll make it her.”  the cook turned to I, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for I: so I departed.  I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling I's brains over the enigmatical character of her, and still more in pondering the problem of her's position at Thornfield and questioning why her had not been given into  custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master’s service. her master’s had almost as much as declared her master’s's conviction of her's criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld her master’s from accusing her? Why had her master’s enjoined me, too, to secrecy? It was strange: her master’s seemed somehow in the power of her; so much in her's power, that even when her lifted her's hand against her master’s's life, her master’s dared not openly charge her with lifted, much less punish her for lifted.  Had her been young and handsome, me should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced her master’s in her's behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as her was, the idea could not be admitted. “Yet,” me reflected, “her has been young once; her's youth would be contemporary with her's : Mrs. Fairfax told me once, her had lived here many years. me don’t think her can ever have been pretty; but, for aught me know, her may. Rochester would have me to come in, and me sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. me never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of the ladies—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.”  “And what was Miss Ingram like?”  “Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as Miss Ingram's jewels. And then Miss Ingram had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls me ever saw. Miss Ingram was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over Miss Ingram's shoulder and across Miss Ingram's breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below Miss Ingram's knee. Miss Ingram wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in such a fine head of hair: an amber-coloured flower contrasted well with the jetty mass of such a fine head of hair.”  “Miss Ingram was greatly admired, of course?”  “Yes, indeed: a nd not only for her beauty, but for her's accomplishments. her was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the piano. her and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.”  “Mr. Rochester? I was not aware Mr. Rochester could sing.”  “Oh! Mr. Rochester has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.”  “And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had Miss Ingram?”  “A very rich and powerful one: Miss Ingram sang delightfully; it was a treat to listen to her;—and Miss Ingram played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but Mr. Rochester is; and I heard Mr. Rochester say Miss Ingram's execution was remarkably good.”  “And Miss Ingram, Miss Ingram is not yet married?”  “It appears not: I fancy neither Miss Ingram nor Miss Ingram's sister have very large fortunes. Miss Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the eldest son came in for everything almost.”  “But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to Miss Ingram: Mr. Rochester, for instance. Mr. Rochester is rich, is Mr. Rochester not?”  “Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr. Rochester ochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.”  “What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.”  “True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the sort. But she eat nothing: she have scarcely tasted since she began tea.”  “No: she am too thirsty to eat. Will I let she have another cup?”  I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester and she; but Adèle came in, and the conversation was turned into another channel.  When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into I's heart, examined my heart's thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.  Arraigned at I's own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight  past; Reason having come forward and told, in Reason's own quiet way, a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—  That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited a more fantastic idiot on sweet lies, and swallowed poison as if poison were nectar.  “_You_,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester? _You_ gifted with the power of pleasing Mr. Rochester? _You_ of importance to Mr. Rochester in any way? Go! You's folly sickens I. And You have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared You? Poor stupid dupe!—Could not even self-interest make You wiser? You repeated to You this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover You's face and be ashamed! He said something in praise of You's eyes, did He? Blind puppy! Open your eyes's bleared lids and look on You r own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by no woman's superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry no woman; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within all women, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds a secret love; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatuus_-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.  “Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to Jane Eyre's sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before Jane Eyre, and draw in chalk Jane Eyre's own picture, faithfully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write under your own picture, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.’  “Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—Jane Eyre have one prepared in Jane Eyre's drawing-box: take Jane Eyre's palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint the loveliest face you can imagine in your softest shades and sweetest lines, according to  the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;—What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order! No snivel!—no sentiment!—no regret! you will endure only sense and resolution. Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aërial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it ‘Blanche Ingram.’  “Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare these two pictures: say, ‘Mr. Rochester might probably win Blanche Ingram's love, if Mr. Rochester chose to strive for that noble lady’s love; is it likely Mr. Rochester would waste a serious thought on Blanche Ingram?’”  “you’ll do it,” you resolved: and having framed resolved, you grew calm, and fell asleep.  you kept you's word. An hour o r two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in crayons; and in less than a fortnight my had completed an ivory miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. an imaginary Blanche Ingram looked a lovely face enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-control could desire. my derived benefit from sketch: sketch had kept my's head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new impressions my wished to stamp indelibly on my's heart.  Ere long, my had reason to congratulate my on the course of wholesome discipline to which my had thus forced my's feelings to submit. Thanks to the course of wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit, my was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had subsequent occurrences found my unprepared, my should probably have been unequal to maintain, even externally.     CHAPTER XVII   A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still Mr. Rochester did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said Mrs. Fairfax should not be surprised if Mr. Rochester were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Contine nt, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; his had not unfrequently quitted Thornfield in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting I to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying I's wits, and recollecting I's principles, I at once called I's sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I cleared up the mistake of supposing his's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled I by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just said—  “You have nothing to do with hisThornfield, further than to receive the salary his gives You for teaching his's protégée, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if You do You's duty, You have a right to expect at his's hands. Be sure that is the only tie his seriously acknowledges bet ween you and him; so don’t make him the object of you's fine feelings, you's raptures, agonies, and so forth. him is not of you's order: keep to you's caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.”  I went on with I's day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across I's brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; these thoughts I did not think to check might germinate and bear fruit if these thoughts I did not think to check could.  him had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.  “a letter is from him,” said Mrs. Fairfax, as Mrs. Fairfax looked at the direction. “Now Mrs. Fairfax suppose we shall know whether we are to expect him's return or not.”  And while Mrs. Fairfax broke the seal and perused a letter, I went on taking I's coffee (we were at breakfast): my coffee was hot, an d I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to I's face. Why I's hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of I's cup into I's saucer, I did not choose to consider.  “Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy enough now: for a little while at least,” said I, still holding the note before I's spectacles.  Ere I permitted I to request an explanation, I tied the string of I's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped I also to another bun and refilled I's mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—  “Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?”  “Indeed Mr. Rochester is—in three days, Mr. Rochester says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either. I don’t know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with Mr. Rochester: Mr. Rochester sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millco te, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring the ladies's maids and the gentlemen the ladies's valets: so we shall have a full house of it.” And I swallowed I's breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.  The three days were, as I had foretold, busy enough. I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since. Adèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and the prospect of company's arrival, seemed to throw Adèle into ecstasies. Adèle would have Sophie to look over all Adèle's “toilettes,” as Adèle called frocks; to furbish up any that were “_passées_,” and to air and arrange the  new. For herself, herself did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From school duties herself was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into Mrs. Fairfax's service, and me was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) Mrs. Fairfax's and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.  The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at six. During the intervening period me had no time to nurse chimeras; and me believe me was as active and gay as anybody—Adèle excepted. Still, now and then, me received a damping check to me's cheerfulness; and was, in spite of me, thrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when me chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage t o the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's glide along the gallery, Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,—just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on. Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's pot of porter with Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief, for Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's private solace, in Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief pass with Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's fellow-servants below; all the rest of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief sat and sewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself,—as companionless as a prisoner in a prisoner in his dungeon's dungeon.  The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except I, noticed Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief's habits, or seemed to marvel at her habits:  no one discussed her position or employment; no one pitied her's solitude or isolation. I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and one of the charwomen remarked—  “her gets good wages, one of the charwomen guess?”  “Yes,” said Leah; “Leah wish Leah had as good; not that Leah are to complain of,—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but good wages’re not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And her is laying by: her goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote. Leah should not wonder but her has saved enough to keep her independent if her liked to leave; but Leah suppose her’s got used to Thornfield; and then her’s not forty yet, and strong and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business.”  “her is a good hand, one of the charwomen daresay,” said one of the charwomen.  “Ah!—she understands what her has to do,—nobody better,” rejoined Leah significantly; “and it is not every one could fill her's shoes—not for all t he money she gets.”  “That it is not!” was the reply. “I wonder whether the master—”  I was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and Leah instantly gave Leah's a nudge.  “Doesn’t Leah know?” me heard I whisper.  Leah shook Leah's head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All me had gathered from it amounted to this,—that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and that from participation in a mystery at Thornfield me was purposely excluded.  Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make both chambers and saloons. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room a nd boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.  Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed Mrs. Fairfax's best black satin gown, Mrs. Fairfax's gloves, and Mrs. Fairfax's gold watch; for it was Mrs. Fairfax's part to receive the company,—to conduct the ladies to the ladies's rooms, &c. Adèle, too, would be dressed: though I thought Adèle had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least. However, to please Adèle, I allowed Sophie to apparel Adèle in one of Sophie's short, full muslin frocks. For I, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit I's sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum my sanctum of the schoolroom was now become to me,—“a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.”  It had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.  “It gets late,” said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  ““ am glad “ ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past six now. “ have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote.” “ went to the window. “Here John is!” said “. “Well, John” (leaning out), “any news?”  “They’re coming, “,” was the answer. “They’ll be here in ten minutes.”  “ flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.  The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after four equestrians came two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled two open carriages; two of four equestrians were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. RochesterMr. Rochester's Mr. Rochester; at Mr. Rochester's side rode a lady, and Mr. Rochester and a lady were the first of the party. a lady's purple riding-habit  almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with her veil's transparent folds, and gleaming through its transparent folds, shone rich raven ringlets.  “Miss Ingram!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away Mrs. Fairfax hurried to Mrs. Fairfax's post below.  The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of the house, and Miss Ingram lost sight of The cavalcade. Adèle now petitioned to go down; but Miss Ingram took Adèle on Miss Ingram's knee, and gave Adèle to understand that Adèle must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, &c. “Some natural tears Adèle shed” on being told this; but as Miss Ingram began to look very grave, Adèle consented at last to wipe Some natural tears.  A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming the master of Thornfield Hall's  s under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.  “Elles changent de toilettes,” said Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement; and Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement sighed.  “Chez maman,” said Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement, “quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au salon et à leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’était si amusant: comme cela on apprend.”  “Don’t Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement feel hungry, Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement?”  “Mais oui, “: voilà cinq ou six heures que nous n’avons pas mangé.”  “Well now, while the ladies are in the ladies's rooms, Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement will venture down and get “ something to eat.”  And issuing from Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement's asylum with precaution, Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement sought a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over the cook's crucibles in a frame of  mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants’ hall two coachmen and three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with the abigails's mistresses; the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind I, when an accelerated hum warned I that the ladies were about to issue from the ladies's chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of the ladies's doors, and running the risk of being surprised with I's cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.  Presently their chambers gave up their chambers's fair tenants one after another: e ach came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. they's collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such as me had never before received.  me found Adèle peeping through the schoolroom door, which Adèle held ajar. “What beautiful ladies!” cried Adèle in English. “Oh, Adèle wish Adèle might go to they! Do me think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after dinner?”  “No, indeed, me don’t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about. Never mind they to-night; perhaps Adèle will see they to-morrow: here is Adèle's dinner.”  Adèle was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert Adèle's attention for a time. It was well me secured this forage, or both Adèle, me, and Sophie, to whom me conveyed a share of our repast,  would have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after nine; and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-cups. I allowed Adèle to sit up much later than usual; for Adèle declared Adèle could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, Adèle added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when Adèle was undressed; “et alors quel dommage!”  I told Adèle's stories as long as Adèle would listen to her stories; and then for a change I took Adèle out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused Adèle to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; Adèle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of  the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet a lady who sang's notes were. The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that I's ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when my ear caught those of Mr. Rochester, which my ear soon did, my ear found a further task in framing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.  The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adèle, whose head leant against I's shoulder; Adèle, whose head leant against my shoulder's eyes were waxing heavy, so I took Adèle, whose head leant against my shoulder up in I's arms and carried Adèle, whose head leant against my shoulder off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought the gentlemen and ladies's chambers.  The next day was as fine as The next day's predecessor: The next day was devoted by the gentlemen and ladies to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. the gentlemen and ladies set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram, a s before, was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at the only lady equestrian's side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with I—  “Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me said it was not likely the two should think of being married,” said I, “but Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers the only lady equestrian to any of the other ladies.”  “Yes, Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me daresay: no doubt Mr. Rochester admires the only lady equestrian.”  “And she Mr. Rochester,” I added; “look how the only lady equestrian leans the only lady equestrian's head towards Mr. Rochester as if the only lady equestrian were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see the only lady equestrian's face; I have never had a glimpse of her face yet.”  “I will see the only lady equestrian this evening,” answered Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me. “Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much the only lady equestrian wished to be introduced to the ladies, and Mr. Rochester said: ‘Oh! let the only lady equestrian come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany the only lady equestrian.’”  “Yes; Mr. Rochester said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,” I answered.  “Well, Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me observed to Mr. Rochester that as I were unused to company, Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me  did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; and he replied, in he's quick way—‘Nonsense! If you objects, tell you it is he's particular wish; and if you resists, say he shall come and fetch you in case of contumacy.’”  “you will not give he that trouble,” you answered. “you will go, if no better may be; but you don’t like it. Shall you be there, you?”  “No; you pleaded off, and he admitted pleaded. you’ll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is the most disagreeable part of the business. you must go into the drawing-room while the drawing-room is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose you's seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let he see you are there and then slip away—nobody will notice you.”  “Will these people remain long, do you think?”  “Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter recess, you ge Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to town and take ge Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote's seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany ge Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote: it surprises I that Mr. Rochester has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield.”  It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to repair with I's charge to the drawing-room. Adèle had been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing Adèle was to be presented to the ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing Adèle that Adèle sobered down. Then the importance of the process quickly steadied Adèle, and by the time Adèle had Adèle's curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, Adèle's pink satin frock put on, Adèle's long sash tied, and Adèle's lace mittens adjusted, Adèle looked as grave as any judge. No need to warn Adèle not to disarrange Adèle's attire: when Adèle was dressed, Adèle sat demurely down in Adèle's little chair, taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear Adèle should crease the satin skirt, and as sured me she would not stir thence till me was ready. This me quickly was: me's best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple’s wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; me's hair was soon smoothed; me's sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.  Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the drawing-room vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation The crimson curtain formed from the party in the adjoining saloon, the party in the adjoining saloon spoke in so low a key that nothing of the party in the adjoining saloon's conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.  she, sat down, without a word, on the footstool me pointed out to she. me retired to  a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to read. Adèle brought Adèle's stool to my feet; ere long Adèle touched my's knee.  “What is it, Adèle?”  “Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques, my? Seulement pour completer Adèle toilette.”  “Adèle think too much of ma toilette,’ Adèle: but Adèle may have a flower.” And my took a rose from a vase and fastened a rose in Adèle's sash. Adèle sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if Adèle's cup of happiness were now full. my turned my's face away to conceal a smile my could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in Adèle's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.  A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the arch; through the arch appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; a band of ladies entered, and the  curtain fell behind them.  There were but eight; yet, somehow, as them flocked in, them gave the impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many were dressed in white; and them had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify them's persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent one or two's heads in return, the others only stared at I.  them dispersed about the room, reminding I, by the lightness and buoyancy of them's movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of them threw Some of them in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: them talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew them's names afterwards, and may as well mention their names now.  First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of Mrs. Eshton's daughters. Mrs. Eshton had evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of two of her daughters, the e ldest, Amy, was rather little: naïve, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; ldest, Amy,'s white muslin dress and blue sash became ldest, Amy, well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffoné_: both sisters were fair as lilies.  Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: Lady Lynn's dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.  Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. Mrs. Colonel Dent had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Mrs. Colonel Dent's black satin dress, Mrs. Colonel Dent's scarf of rich foreign lace, and Mrs. Colonel Dent's pearl ornaments, pleased I better than the rainbow radiance of Lady Lynn.  But the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and the Dowager Lady Ingram's daughters, Blanche and Mary. the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary w ere all three of the loftiest stature of women. The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: The Dowager's shape was still fine; The Dowager's hair (by candle-light at least) still black; The Dowager's teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people would have termed The Dowager a splendid woman of The Dowager's age: and so The Dowager was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in The Dowager's bearing and countenance. The Dowager had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: Roman features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural erectness. The Dowager had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: a fierce and a hard eye reminded me of Mrs. Reed’s; The Dowager mouthed The Dowager's words in speaking; The Dowager's voice was deep, her voice's inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,—very intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested The Dowager (me  suppose she thought) with a truly imperial dignity.  Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,—straight and tall as poplars. Mary was too slim for Mary's height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian. I regarded Blanche, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to see whether Blanche's appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description; secondly, whether her appearance at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of Blanche; and thirdly—it will out!—whether her appearance were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester’s taste.  As far as person went, Blanche answered point for point, both to I's picture and Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but Blanche's face? her face was like Blanche's mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! Blanche laughed continually; Blanche's laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of Blanche a rched and haughty lip.  Genius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a genius, but Miss Ingram was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious indeed. Miss Ingram entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed the gentle Mrs. Dent had not studied botany: though, as the gentle Mrs. Dent said, the gentle Mrs. Dent liked flowers, “especially wild ones;” Miss Ingram had, and Miss Ingram ran over botany's vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived Miss Ingram was (what is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ the gentle Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on the gentle Mrs. Dent's ignorance; Miss Ingram's _trail_ might be clever, but her _trail_ was decidedly not good-natured. Miss Ingram played: Miss Ingram's execution was brilliant; Miss Ingram sang: Miss Ingram's voice was fine; Miss Ingram talked French apart to Miss Ingram's mamma; and Miss Ingram talked French well, with fluency and with a good accent.  Miss Ingram had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard)—but Miss Ingram was deficient in life: Miss Ingram's face lacked expression, Miss Ingram's eye lustre; Miss Ingram had no thing to say, and having once taken her seat, remained fixed like a statue in a statue's niche. The sisters were both attired in spotless white.  And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make? I could not tell—I did not know Mr. Rochester's taste in female beauty. If Mr. Rochester liked the majestic, Miss Ingram was the very type of majesty: then Miss Ingram was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire Miss Ingram, I thought; and that Mr. Rochester _did_ admire Miss Ingram, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them together.  I are not to suppose, I, that Adèle has all this time been sitting motionless on the stool at I's feet: no; when The sisters entered, Adèle rose, advanced to meet The sisters, made a stately reverence, and said with gravity—  “Bon jour, mesdames.”  And Mr. Rochester had looked down at Adèle with a mocking air, and exclaimed, “Oh, what a little puppet!”  Lady Lynn had remarked, “Adèle is Mr. Rochester's ward, Lady Lynn suppose—the little Fren ch girl he was speaking of.”  Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss. Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously—  “What a love of a child!”  And then Amy and Louisa Eshton had called her to a sofa, where her now sat, ensconced between Amy and Louisa Eshton, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only Amy and Louisa Eshton's attention, but that of Louisa Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her's heart’s content.  At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. her sit in the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the window-curtain half hides her. Again the arch yawns; the gentlemen come. The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of Amy and Louisa Eshton, is very imposing: the gentlemen are all costumed in black; most of the gentlemen are tall, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Mrs. Dent is a fine soldierly man. Louisa Eshton, is gentleman-like: Louisa Eshton's hair is quite white, Louisa Eshton's eyebrows and w hiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a “père noble de théâtre.” him, like him's sisters, is very tall; like his sisters, also, him is handsome; but him shares Mary’s apathetic and listless look: him seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.  And where is Mr. Rochester?  Mr. Rochester comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see Mr. Rochester enter. I try to concentrate I's attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in I's hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in I's lap; whereas, I distinctly behold Mr. Rochester's figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw his figure; just after I had rendered Mr. Rochester, what Mr. Rochester deemed, an essential service, and Mr. Rochester, holding I's hand, and looking down on I's face, surveyed I with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached Mr. Rochester at that moment! What had oc curred since, calculated to change his and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged his and my were! So far estranged, that my did not expect his to come and speak to my. my did not wonder, when, without looking at my, his took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.  No sooner did my see that his's attention was riveted on some of the ladies, and that my might gaze without being observed, than my's eyes were drawn involuntarily to his's face; my could not keep my eyes's lids under control: my eyes would rise, and the irids would fix on his. my looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which the thirst-perishing man has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.  Most true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.” his's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows , deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision, will,—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me,—that took me's feelings from me's own power and fettered my feelings in his. me had not intended to love his; the reader knows me had wrought hard to extirpate from me's soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of his, the germs of love there detected spontaneously arrived, green and strong! his made me love his without looking at me.  me compared his with his's guests. What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,—even the military distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with Colonel Dent's look of native pith and genuine power? me had no sympathy in his guests's appearance, his guests's expression: yet me could imagine that most observers would call his guests attractive, handsome, imposing; while most observers would pronounce his at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in the light of the candles as them's smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as them's laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile:—his stern features softened; Mr. Rochester's eye grew both brilliant and gentle, his eye's ray both searching and sweet. Mr. Rochester was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see Louisa and Amy Eshton receive with calm that look which seemed to I so penetrating: I expected Louisa and Amy Eshton's eyes to fall, Louisa and Amy Eshton's colour to rise under that look which seemed to me so penetrating; yet I was glad when I found Louisa and Amy Eshton were in no sense moved. “Mr. Rochester is not to Louisa and Amy Eshton what Mr. Rochester is to I,” I thought: “Mr. Rochester is not of Louisa and Amy Eshton's kind. I believe Mr. Rochester is of mine;—I am sure Mr. Rochester is—I feel akin to Mr. Rochester—I understand the language of Mr. Rochester's countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in I's brain and heart, in I's blood and nerves, that assimilates I mentally to Mr. Rochester. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with Mr. Rochester but to receive I's salary at Mr. Rochester's hands? Did I  forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling myself have gathers impulsively round him. myself know myself must conceal myself's sentiments: myself must smother hope; myself must remember that him cannot care much for myself. For when myself say that myself am of him's kind, myself do not mean that myself have him's force to influence, and him's spell to attract; myself mean only that myself have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. myself must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:—and yet, while myself breathe and think, myself must love him.”  Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton's wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir George—whom, by-the-bye, myself have forgotten to describe,—a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram's sofa, coffee-cup in ha nd, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing Mary Ingram the engravings of a splendid volume: Mary Ingram looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; Mary Ingram glances up at The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram, and chatters like a wren: Mary Ingram likes The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram better than Mary Ingram does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Adèle shares an ottoman at the feet of Louisa with Henry Lynn: Henry Lynn is trying to talk French with Louisa, and Louisa laughs at Henry Lynn's blunders. With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? Blanche Ingram is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album. Blanche Ingram seems waiting to be sought; but Blanche Ingram will not wait too long: Blanche Ingram Blanche Ingram selects a mate.  Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as Blanche Ingram stands by the table: Blanche Ingram confronts Mr. Rochester, taking Blanche Ingram's station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.  “Mr. Rochester, Blanche Ingram thought Mr. Rochester ou were not fond of children?”  “Nor am I.”  “Then, what induced I. to take charge of such a little doll as that?” (pointing to that). “Where did I. pick that up?”  “I. did not pick that up; that was left on I.'s hands.”  “I. should have sent that to school.”  “I. could not afford sent: schools are so dear.”  “Why, I suppose I. have a governess for that: I saw a person with that just now—is that gone? Oh, no! there that is still, behind the window-curtain. I. pay that, of course; I should think it quite as expensive,—more so; for I. have them both to keep in addition.”  I feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to I would make I. glance I's way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but I. never turned I.'s eyes.  “I. have not considered the subject,” said I. indifferently, looking straight before I..  “No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in o ur day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi—were them not, mama?”  “Did you speak, you?”  The young lady thus claimed as the dowager’s special property, reiterated you's question with an explanation.  “the dowager’s's , don’t mention governesses; the word makes the dowager’s nervous. the dowager’s have suffered a martyrdom from governesses's incompetency and caprice. the dowager’s thank Heaven the dowager’s have now done with governesses!”  Mrs. Dent here bent over to the dowager’s and whispered something in the dowager’s's ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the anathematised race was present.  “Tant pis!” said the dowager’s, “the dowager’s hope it may do the dowager’s good!” Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for I to hear, “the dowager’s noticed the dowager’s; the dowager’s am a judge of physiognomy, and in the dowager’s the dowager’s see all the faults of the dowager’s's class.”  “What are all the faults of her class, the dowager’s?” inquired I aloud.  “the dowager’s will tell I in I's private ear,” replied the dowager’s, wagging the dowager’s's turban three times with portentous significancy.  “But the dowager’s's curiosity will be p ast its appetite; its craves food now.”  “Ask Blanche; Blanche is nearer Blanche than I.”  “Oh, don’t refer Blanche to Blanche, mama! Blanche have just one word to say of the whole tribe; the whole tribe are a nuisance. Not that Blanche ever suffered much from the whole tribe; Blanche took care to turn the tables. What tricks Blanche and Blanche used to play on Theodore and I's Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was with Madame Jouberts: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Greys was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on Mrs. Greys. But Madame Jouberts! Blanche see Madame Jouberts yet in Madame Jouberts's raging passions, when Theodore and I had driven Madame Jouberts to extremities—spilt Theodore and I's tea, crumbled Theodore and I's bread and butter, tossed Theodore and I's books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Blanche, do Blanche remember those merry days?”  “Yaas, to be sure Blanche do,” drawled Blanche; “and the poor o ld stick used to cry out ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonised ld stick on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when ld stick was ld stick so ignorant.”  “we did; and, Tedo, Tedo know, I helped Tedo in prosecuting (or persecuting) Tedo's tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, as we used to call your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, as we used to call him. your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, as we used to call him and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other—at least Tedo I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ‘la belle passion,’ and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of we's discovery; we employed our discovery as a sort of lever to hoist we's dead-weights from the house. ld stick, there, as soon as ld stick got an inkling of the business, found out that the business was of an immoral tendency. Did ld stick not, I's ?”  “Certainly, ld stick's best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment i n any well-regulated house; firstly—”  “Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! _Au reste_, we all know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence accompanying—mutiny and general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?”  “I, I are right now, as always.”  “Then no more need be said: change the subject.”  Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with Amy Eshton's soft, infantine tone: “Louisa and Amy Eshton used to quiz Louisa and I's governess too; but our governess was such a good creature, our governess would bear anything: nothing put our governess out. our governess was never cross with Louisa and I; was our governess, Louisa?”  “No, never: Louisa and I might do what Louisa and I pleased; ransack our governess's desk and our governess's workbox, and turn our governess's drawers inside out; and our governess was so good-natured, our governess would give Louisa and I anything Louisa and I asked for.”  “I suppose, now,” said Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park, curling Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park's lip sarcastic ally, “we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic. Mr. Rochester, do Mr. Rochester second I's motion?”  “I, Mr. Rochester support I on this point, as on every other.”  “Then on I be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are Signior Eduardo in voice to-night?”  “Donna Bianca, if Donna Bianca command it, Signior Eduardo will be.”  “Then, Signior Eduardo, I lay on Signior Eduardo I's sovereign behest to furbish up Signior Eduardo's lungs and other vocal organs, as your lungs and other vocal organs will be wanted on I's royal service.”  “Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?”  “A fig for Rizzio!” cried Donna Bianca, tossing Donna Bianca's head with all her head with all its curls's curls, as Donna Bianca moved to the piano. “It is Donna Bianca's opinion the fiddler David must have been an insipid sort of fellow; Donna Bianca like black Bothwell better: to Donna Bianca's mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in a man; and history may say what history will of James Hepburn, but Donna Bianca have a notion, James Hepburn was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom Donna Bianca coul d have consented to gift with my hand.”  “Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of Gentlemen most resembles Bothwell?” cried Mr. Rochester.  “I should say the preference lies with I,” responded I.  “On I's honour, I am much obliged to I,” was the reply.  Miss Ingram, who had now seated Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude with proud grace at the piano, spreading out Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude's snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant prelude; talking meantime. Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude appeared to be on Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude's high horse to-night; both Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude's words and Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude's air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude's auditors: Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude was evidently bent on striking her auditors as something very dashing and daring indeed.  “Oh, Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, rattling away at the instrument. “Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa’s park gates: nor to go even so far without papa’s's permission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their's white hands, and thei r small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman—woman's legitimate appanage and heritage! I grant an ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the _gentlemen_, let the _gentlemen be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let the _gentlemen's motto be:—Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip. Such should be I's device, were I a man.”  “Whenever I marry,” I continued after a pause which none interrupted, “I am resolved I's husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to I. I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: my husband's devotions shall not be shared between I and the shape my husband sees in my husband's mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for Mr. Rochester.”  “Mr. Rochester am all obedience,” was the response.  “Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that reason, sing a Corsair-song _con spirito_.”  “Commands from Miss Ingram’s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and wat er.”  “Take care, then: if you don’t please me, me will shame you by showing how such things _should_ be done.”  “That is offering a premium on incapacity: you shall now endeavour to fail.”  “Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, me shall devise a proportionate punishment.”  “Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for Miss Ingram has it in Miss Ingram's power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.”  “Ha! explain!” commanded you.  “Pardon me, you: no need of explanation; you's own fine sense must inform you that one of you's frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment.”  “Sing!” said Miss Ingram, and again touching the piano, Miss Ingram commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.  “Now is me's time to slip away,” thought me: but the tones that then severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: Mr. Rochester did—a mellow, powerful bass, into which Mr. Rochester threw Mr. Rochester's own feeling, Mr. Rochester's own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation st rangely. I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed the tide of talk, checked an instant,'s flow; I then quitted I's sheltered corner and made I's exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near. Thence a narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing a narrow passage, I perceived I's sandal was loose; I stopped to tie my sandal, kneeling down for tie on the mat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with a gentleman: a gentleman was a gentleman.  “How do I do?” a gentleman asked.  “I am very well, a gentleman.”  “Why did I not come and speak to a gentleman in the room?”  I thought I might have retorted the question on a gentlemanthe question: but I would not take that freedom. I answered—  “I did not wish to disturb a gentleman, as a gentleman seemed engaged, a gentleman.”  “What have I been doing during a gentleman's absence?”  “Nothing particular; teaching Adèle as usual.”  “And getting a good deal paler than I were—as a gentleman saw at first sight. What is th e matter?”  “Nothing at all, sir.”  “Did sir take any cold that night sir half drowned sir?”  “Not the least.”  “Return to the drawing-room: sir are deserting too early.”  “sir am tired, sir.”  sir looked at sir for a minute.  “And a little depressed,” sir said. “What about? Tell sir.”  “Nothing—nothing, sir. sir am not depressed.”  “But sir affirm that sir are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring tears to sir's eyes—indeed, your eyes are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag. If sir had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, sir would know what all this means. Well, to-night sir excuse sir; but understand that so long as sir's visitors stay, sir expect sir to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is sir's wish; don’t neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adèle. Good-night, sir's—” sir stopped, bit sir's lip, and abruptly left sir.     CHAPTER XVIII   Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy da ys too: how different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude ys had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now driven from its, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady’s-maid or a dandy valet.  The kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the servants’ hall, the entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called the saloons's occupants out into the grounds. Even when the genial spring weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.  ys wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of  “playing charades,” but in my ignorance my did not understand the term. The servants were called in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for the ladies's maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and certain wardrobes of the third storey's contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round Mr. Rochester, and was selecting certain of the ladies's number to be of Mr. Rochester's party. “Miss Ingram is mine, of course,” said Mr. Rochester: afterwards  he named the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. he looked at me: me happened to be near he, as me had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.  “Will me play?” he asked. me shook me's head. he did not insist, which me rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to me's usual seat.  he and he's aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by Mrs. Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that me should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.  “No,” me heard Lady Ingram say: “me looks too stupid for any game of the sort.”  Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, on a table, lay open a large book; and at Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen's side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's cloak, and holding a bo ok in her hand. Somebody, unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her guardian’s party)'s guardian’s party), bounded forward, scattering round Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her guardian’s party) the contents of a basket of flowers Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her guardian’s party) carried on Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her guardian’s party)'s arm. Then appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of roses round her brow's head, and a wreath of roses round the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of roses round her brow's brow; by the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of roses round her brow's side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they drew near the table. they knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white's stations behind they. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At A ceremony's termination, Colonel Dent and Colonel Dent's party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then Colonel Dent called out—  “Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.  A considerable interval elapsed before the curtain again rose. the curtain's second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps abo ve the dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the dining-room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been transported with some trouble, on account of it's size and weight.  Seated on the carpet, by the side of it, was seen Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head's head. Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head's dark eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. Miss Ingram, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about Miss Ingram's temples; Miss Ingram's beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of her beautifully-moulded arms upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on Miss Ingram's head. Both Miss Ingram's cast of form and feature, Miss Ingram's complexion and h er general air, suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent.  she approached the basin, and bent over the basin as if to fill she's pitcher; she again lifted her pitcher to she's head. The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost she; to make some request:—“She hasted, let down her pitcher on she's hand, and gave him to drink.” From the bosom of The personage on the well-brink's robe The personage on the well-brink then produced a casket, opened a casket and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, The personage on the well-brink laid magnificent bracelets and earrings at she's feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by she's looks and gestures; The personage on the well-brink fastened the bracelets on she's arms and the rings in she's ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting.  The divining party again laid The divining party's heads together: apparently The divining party could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated. Colonel Dent, The divining party's spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whol e;” whereupon the curtain again descended.  On the curtain's third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in The marble basin's place, stood a deal table and a kitchen chair: a deal table and a kitchen chair were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.  Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground's clenched hands resting on a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground's knees, and a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground's eyes bent on the ground. I knew a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground's coat hanging loose from one arm, as if his coat had been almost torn from a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground's back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. As a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground moved, a chain clanked; to a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground's wrists were attached fetters.  “Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.  A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume the performers's ordinary cos tume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in Miss Ingram; Miss Ingram was complimenting Mr. Rochester on Mr. Rochester's acting.  “Do Mr. Rochester know,” said Miss Ingram, “that, of the three characters, Miss Ingram liked Mr. Rochester in the last best? Oh, had Mr. Rochester but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant gentleman-highwayman Mr. Rochester would have made!”  “Is all the soot washed from Mr. Rochester's face?” Mr. Rochester asked, turning my face towards Miss Ingram.  “Alas! yes: the more’s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to Mr. Rochester's complexion than that ruffian’s rouge.”  “Miss Ingram would like a hero of the road then?”  “An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit; and An English hero of the road could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.”  “Well, whatever Mr. Rochester am, remember Miss Ingram are Mr. Rochester's wife; we were married an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses.” Miss Ingram giggled, and Miss Ingram's colour rose.  “Now, Dent,” continued Mr. Rochester, “it is Dent's turn.” And as the other party withdrew, they took the vacated seats. Miss Ingram placed Miss Ingram at Mr. Rochester's r ight hand; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; I's attention was absorbed by the spectators; I's eyes, erewhile fixed on the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs. What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word Colonel Dent and his party chose, how Colonel Dent and his party acquitted Colonel Dent and his party, I no longer remember; but I still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see her turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to her; I see her's incline her's head towards her, till the jetty curls almost touch her's shoulder and wave against her's cheek; I hear him and her's mutual whisperings; I recall him and her's interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.  I have told you, you, that I had learnt to love her: I could not unlove her now, merely because I found that her had ceased to notice I—because I might  pass hours in his presence, and his would never once turn his's eyes in my direction—because my saw all his's attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch my with the hem of her robes as her passed; who, if ever her's dark and imperious eye fell on my by chance, would withdraw her dark and imperious eye instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. my could not unlove his, because my felt sure his would soon marry her—because my read daily in her a proud security in his's intentions respecting her—because my witnessed hourly in his a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its's very pride, irresistible.  There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, you, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my's position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram’s. But my was not jealous: or very rarely;—the nature  of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: Miss Ingram was too inferior to excite jealousy. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. Miss Ingram was very showy, but Miss Ingram was not genuine: Miss Ingram had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but Miss Ingram's mind was poor, Miss Ingram's heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. Miss Ingram was not good; Miss Ingram was not original: Miss Ingram used to repeat sounding phrases from books: Miss Ingram never offered, nor had, an opinion of Miss Ingram's own. Miss Ingram advocated a high tone of sentiment; but Miss Ingram did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in Miss Ingram. Too often Miss Ingram betrayed were, by the undue vent Miss Ingram gave to a spiteful antipathy Miss Ingram had conceived against little Adèle: pushing little Adèle away with some contumelious epithet if little Adèle happened to approach little Adèle; sometimes ordering little Adèle from the room, and always treating little Adèle with coldness and acrimo ny. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character—watched these manifestations of character closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself's intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this guardedness of the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself's—this perfect, clear consciousness of his intended's defects—this obvious absence of passion in the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself's sentiments towards his intended, that mine's ever-torturing pain arose.  mine saw the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself was going to marry his intended, for family, perhaps political reasons, because his intended's rank and connections suited the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself; mine felt the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself had not given his intended the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself's love, and that his intended's qualifications were ill adapted to win from the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself his love. This was the point—This was where the nerve was touched and teased—This was where the fever was sustained and fed: _his intended could not charm the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself_.  If his intended had managed the victory at once, and the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself had yielded and sincerely laid the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself's heart at his intended's feet, mine should have covered mine's face, turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss  Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers—jealousy and despair: then, I's heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired Ingram—acknowledged Ingram's excellence, and been quiet for the rest of I's days: and the more absolute Ingram's superiority, the deeper would have been I's admiration—the more truly tranquil I's quiescence. But as matters really stood, to watch Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure—Ingram unconscious that their did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming Ingram on success, when Ingram's pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what Ingram wished to allure—to witness _this_, was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.  Because, when Ingram failed, I saw how Ingram might have succeeded. Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell harmless  at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have quivered keen in his's proud heart—have called love into his's stern eye, and softness into his's sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a silent conquest might have been won.  “Why can she not influence his more, when she is privileged to draw so near to his?” I asked I. “Surely she cannot truly like his, or not like his with true affection! If she did, she need not coin she's smiles so lavishly, flash she's glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to I that she might, by merely sitting quietly at his's side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his's heart. I have seen in his's face a far different expression from that which hardens his face now while she is so vivaciously accosting his; but then it came of it: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer what his asked without pretension, to address his when nee dful without grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when they are married? I do not think she will manage please; and yet please might be managed; and him's might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.”  I have not yet said anything condemnatory of him's project of marrying for interest and connections. It surprised I when I first discovered that such was him's intention: I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in him's choice of a wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into him or Miss Ingram, doubtless, from him or Miss Ingram's childhood. All him or Miss Ingram's class held ideas and principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood: I supposed, then, All their class had reasons for holding ideas and principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood such as I could not fathom. It seemed to I that, were I  a gentleman like him, I would take to I's bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the advantages to him's own happiness offered by this plan convinced I that there must be arguments against this plan's general adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act.  But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to him: I was forgetting all him's faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out. It had formerly been I's endeavour to study all sides of him's character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled I once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once's presence was pungent, but The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once's absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And as for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a desponding expression?— that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in a careful observer's eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if me had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen the ground gape: that something, me, at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun, me longed only to dare—to divine that something; and me thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day Miss Ingram might look into the abyss at Miss Ingram's leisure, explore the abyss's secrets and analyse its secrets's nature.  Meantime, while me thought only of me's master and my master's future bride—saw my master and his future bride, heard only their discourse, and considered only my master and his future bride's movements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with the rest of the party's own separate interests and pleasures. my master and his future bride continued to consort in solemn conferences, where my master and his future bride nodded my master and his future bride's two turbans at each other, and held up t heir four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and good-natured Mrs. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business. Lord Ingram flirted with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended all's by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected with Mr. Rochester—Mary Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If Mr. Rochester was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of Mr. Rochester's guests; and Mr. Rochester's re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.  The want of Mr. Rochester's animating  influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw Blanche Ingram into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the library, had flung Blanche Ingram in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players was heard  from above.  It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—  “Voilà me, qui revient!”  me turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from Miss Ingram's sofa: the others, too, looked up from the others's several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.  “What can possess me to come home in that style?” said Miss Ingram. “me rode Mesrour (the black horse), did me not, when me went out? and Pilot was with him:—what has me done with the animals?”  As Miss Ingram said this, Miss Ingram approached Miss Ingram's tall person and ample garments so near the window, that me was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of me's spine: in Miss Ingram's eagerness Miss Ingram did not observe me at first, but when Miss Ingram did, Miss Ingram curled Miss Ingram's lip and moved to another casement. A post-chaise stopped; th e driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but a gentleman was not Mr. Rochester; a gentleman was a gentleman.  “How provoking!” exclaimed Miss Ingram: “you tiresome monkey!” (apostrophising Adèle), “who perched you tiresome monkey up in the window to give false intelligence?” and Miss Ingram cast on me an angry glance, as if me were in fault.  Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon a gentleman entered. a gentleman bowed to Miss Ingram, as deeming Miss Ingram the eldest lady present.  “It appears a gentleman come at an inopportune time, Miss Ingram,” said a gentleman, “when Mr. Rochester, is from home; but a gentleman arrive from a very long journey, and a gentleman think a gentleman may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal a gentleman here till Mr. Rochester returns.”  a gentleman's manner was polite; a gentleman's accent, in speaking, struck me as being somewhat unusual,—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether English: a gentleman's age might be about Mr. Rochester’s,—between thirty and forty; a gentleman's complexion was singu larly sallow: otherwise larly sallow was a fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you detected something in larly sallow's face that displeased, or rather that failed to please. larly sallow's features were regular, but too relaxed: larly sallow's eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of his eye was a tame, vacant life—at least so I thought.  The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till after dinner that I saw larly sallow again: larly sallow then seemed quite at larly sallow's ease. But I liked larly sallow's physiognomy even less than before: his physiognomy struck I as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. larly sallow's eye wandered, and had no meaning in His eye's wandering: wandered gave larly sallow an odd look, such as I never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking man, larly sallow repelled I exceedingly: there was no power in his face: no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown  eye.  As I sat in I's usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for him occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if him were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, a meek sheep's guardian.  him had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage that “extremes meet.”  Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps of Two or three of the gentlemen's conversation across the room. At first I could not make much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to I, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached I at intervals. Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, were discussing him; Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, called him “a beaut iful man.” Louisa said he was “a love of a creature,” and Louisa “adored he;” and Mary instanced he's “pretty little mouth, and nice nose,” as Mary's ideal of the charming.  “And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!” cried Louisa,—“so smooth—none of those frowning irregularities Louisa dislike so much; and such a placid eye and smile!”  And then, to my great relief, Mary summoned them to the other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.  my was now able to concentrate my's attention on them, and my presently gathered that he was called Mr. Mason; then my learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, he's face was so sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated the West Indies as he's residence; and it was with no little surprise my gathered, ere long, tha t he had there first seen and become acquainted with Mr. Rochester. he spoke of Mr. Rochester's dislike of the burning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr. Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded Mr. Rochester's wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.  I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected one, broke the thread of I's musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire, which had burnt out the fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red's flame, though the fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red's mass of cinder still shone hot and red. The footman who brought more coal, in going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton’s chair, and said something to Mr. Eshton’s in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, “old woman,”—“quite troublesome.”  “Tell Mr. Mason Mr. Mason shall be put in the stocks if Mr. Mason does not take Mr. Mason off,” replied Mr. Eshton’s.  “No—stop!” interrupted Colonel  Dent. “Don’t send her away, Eshton; we might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.” And speaking aloud, he continued—“Ladies, the ladies talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that her is in the servants’ hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought in before ‘the quality,’ to tell ‘the quality ‘the quality's fortunes. Would the ladies like to see her?”  “Surely, he,” cried Lady Ingram, “he would not encourage such a low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!”  “But Sam cannot persuade her to go away, Lady Ingram,” said Sam; “nor can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating her to be gone; but her has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir her from a chair in the chimney-corner till her gets leave to come in here.”  “What does her want?” asked Eshton.  “‘To tell the gentry the gentry's fortunes,’ her says, Eshton; and her swears her must and will do tell.”  “What is her like?” inquired Eshton , in a breath.  “A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.”  “Why, miss’s a real sorceress!” cried Frederick Lynn. “Let us have miss in, of course.”  “To be sure,” rejoined Frederick Lynn; “it would be a thousand pities to throw away such a chance of fun.”  “My dear boys, what are My dear boys thinking about?” exclaimed Frederick Lynn.  “My cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,” chimed in My.  “Indeed, My, but My can—and will,” pronounced the haughty voice of Blanche, as Blanche turned round on the piano-stool; where till now Blanche had sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. “Blanche have a curiosity to hear Blanche's fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame forward.”  “Sam's ! recollect—”  “Blanche do—Blanche recollect all Sam can suggest; and Blanche must have Blanche's will—quick, Sam!”  “Yes—yes—yes!” cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. “Let miss come—it will be excellent sport!”  The footman still lingered. “miss looks such a ro ugh one,” said he.  “Go!” ejaculated Miss Ingram, and he went.  Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.  “She won’t come now,” said Sam. “She says it’s not She's mission to appear before the ‘vulgar herd’ (them’s She's words). Sam must show She into a room by She, and then those who wish to consult She must go to She's one by one.”  “You see now, You,” began Miss Ingram, “She encroaches. Be advised, Miss Ingram's angel girl—and—”  “Show She into the library, of course,” cut in my angel girl.” “It is not Sam's mission to listen to She before the ‘vulgar herd’ either: Sam mean to have She all to Sam. Is there a fire in the library?”  “Yes, Sam—but She looks such a tinkler.”  “Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do Sam's bidding.”  Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow once more.  “She’s ready now,” said Sam, as Sam reappeared. “She wishes to know who will be She's first vi sitor.”  “I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,” said I.  “Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.”  Sam went and returned.  “her says, I, that her’ll have no gentlemen; no gentlemen need not trouble no gentlemen to come near her; nor,” Sam added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, “any ladies either, except the young, and single.”  “By Jove, her has taste!” exclaimed Henry Lynn.  her rose solemnly: “her go first,” her said, in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of his men's men.  “Oh, her's best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!” was my's cry; but her swept past my in stately silence, passed through the door which I held open, and we heard her enter the library.  A comparative silence ensued. her thought it “le cas” to wring her's hands: which her did accordingly. my declared my felt, for my's part, my never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under Amy and Louisa Eshton's  breath, and looked a little frightened.  The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.  Would Miss Ingram laugh? Would Miss Ingram take it as a joke? All eyes met Miss Ingram with a glance of eager curiosity, and Miss Ingram met All eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; Miss Ingram looked neither flurried nor merry: Miss Ingram walked stiffly to Miss Ingram's seat, and took her seat in silence.  “Well, Miss Ingram?” said Lord Ingram.  “What did Miss Ingram say, sister?” asked Mary.  “What did sister think? How do sister feel? Is Miss Ingram a real fortune-teller?” demanded the Misses Eshton.  “Now, now, good people,” returned Miss Ingram, “don’t press upon Miss Ingram. Really good people's organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: good people seem, by the importance of good people—Miss Ingram's good mama included—ascribe to this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. Miss Ingram have seen a gipsy vagabond; a gipsy vagabond has practised in hackneyed fashion the s cience of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. me's whim is gratified; and now me think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow morning, as Mr. Eshton threatened.”  the hag took a book, leant back in the hag's chair, and so declined further conversation. me watched the hag for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time the hag never turned a page, and the hag's face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. the hag had obviously not heard anything to the hag's advantage: and it seemed to me, from the hag's prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that the hagthe hag, notwithstanding the hag's professed indifference, attached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made the hag.   During all that time the hag never turned a page  Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Mr. Eshton, declared Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton dared not go alone; and yet Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton wished to go. A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, me think, th e said Sam’s calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from Sam’s, for the three to wait upon Sam’s in a body.  the three's visit was not so still as Miss Ingram’s had been: we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of about twenty minutes the three burst the door open, and came running across the hall, as if the three were half-scared out of the three's wits.  “I am sure Sam’s is something not right!” the three cried, one and all. “Sam’s told the three such things! Sam’s knows all about the three!” and the three sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring the three.  Pressed for further explanation, the three declared Sam’s had told the three of things the three had said and done when the three were mere children; described books and ornaments the three had in the three's boudoirs at home: keepsakes that different relations had presented to the three. the three affirmed that Sam’s had even divined the three's thoughts, and had whispered in the ear o f each the name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed she of what she most wished for.  Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last-named points; but the gentlemen got only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for the gentlemen's importunity. The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the expression of The matrons's concern that The matrons's warning had not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged the younger's services on the agitated fair ones.  In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in the scene before my, my heard a hem close at my's elbow: my turned, and saw Sam.  “If my please, my, the gipsy declares that there is another young single lady in the room who has not been to the gipsy yet, and another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet swears another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet will not go till another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet has seen all. Sam thought it must be my: there is no one else for it. What shall Sam tell another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet?”  “Oh,  I will go by all means,” I answered: and I was glad of the unexpected opportunity to gratify I's much-excited curiosity. I slipped out of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned—and I closed the door quietly behind I.  “If I like, I,” said Sam, “Sam’ll wait in the hall for I; and if she frightens I, just call and Sam’ll come in.”  “No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.” Nor was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.     CHAPTER XIX   The library looked tranquil enough as I entered The library, and she—if Sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-corner. she had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under she's chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the fire: s he muttered the words to he, as most old women do, while he read; he did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared he wished to finish a paragraph.  my stood on the rug and warmed my's hands, which were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. my felt now as composed as ever my did in my's life: there was nothing indeed in he's appearance to trouble one’s calm. he shut he's book and slowly looked up; he's hat-brim partially shaded he's face, yet my could see, as he raised her hat-brim, that her hat-brim was a strange one. her hat-brim looked all brown and black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under he's chin, and came half over he's cheeks, or rather jaws: he's eye confronted my at once, with a bold and direct gaze.  “Well, and my want my's fortune told?” he said, in a voice as decided as he's glance, as harsh as he's features.  “my don’t care about your fortune, he; he may please he: but my ought to warn he, my have no faith.”  “It’s like my's imp udence to say so: I expected it of udence; I heard it in udence's step as udence crossed the threshold.”  “Did udence? udence’ve a quick ear.”  “udence have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.”  “udence need them all in udence's trade.”  “udence do; especially when udence’ve customers like udence to deal with. Why don’t udence tremble?”  “udence’m not cold.”  “Why don’t udence turn pale?”  “udence am not sick.”  “Why don’t udence consult udence's art?”  “udence’m not silly.”  The old crone “nichered” a laugh under The old crone's bonnet and bandage; The old crone then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting a short black pipe began to smoke. Having indulged a while in this sedative, The old crone raised The old crone's bent body, took a short black pipe from The old crone's lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very deliberately—  “udence are cold; udence are sick; and udence are silly.”  “Prove it,” udence rejoined.  “udence will, in few words. The old crone are cold, because The old crone are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you that is in The old crone. The old crone are sick; because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from The old crone ou. You are silly, because, suffer as You may, You will not beckon it to approach, nor will You stir one step to meet it where it waits You.”  She again put She's short black pipe to She's lips, and renewed She's smoking with vigour.  “She might say all that to almost any one who She knew lived as a solitary dependent in a great house.”  “She might say all that to almost any one: but would all that be true of almost any one?”  “In She's circumstances.”  “Yes; just so, in my circumstancesmy circumstances: but find She another precisely placed as She are.”  “It would be easy to find She thousands.”  “She could scarcely find She one. If She knew it, She are peculiarly situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of happiness. The materials are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine The materials. Chance laid The materials somewhat apart; let The materials be once approached and bliss results.”  “She don’t understand enigmas. She never could guess a riddle in She's life.”  “If She wish She to speak more plainly, show She She's palm.”  “And She must cros s it with silver, I suppose?”  “To be sure.”  I gave her a shilling: her put a shilling into an old stocking-foot which her took out of her's pocket, and having tied an old stocking-foot which she took out of her pocket round and returned an old stocking-foot which she took out of her pocket, her told I to hold out I's hand. I did. her approached her's face to the palm, and pored over the palm without touching the palm.  “the palm is too fine,” said her. “her can make nothing of such a hand as my hand; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not written there.”  “I believe her,” said I  “No,” her continued, “Destiny is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up I's head.”  “Ah! now her are coming to reality,” I said, as I obeyed her. “I shall begin to put some faith in her presently.”  I knelt within half a yard of her. her stirred the fire, so that a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as her sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: I, the glare illumined.  “I wonder with what feelings I came to I to-night,” her said, w hen she had examined me a while. “I wonder what thoughts are busy in me's heart during all the hours me sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before me like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic communion passing between me and the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern as if the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.”  “me feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.”  “Then me have some secret hope to buoy me up and please me with whispers of the future?”  “Not I. The utmost me hope is, to save money enough out of me's earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by me.”  “A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-seat (you see I know me's habits)—”  “me have learned your habits from the servants.”  “Ah! me think me sharp. Well, perhaps me have: to speak truth, me have an acquaintance with one of the servants, Mrs. Poole—”  me started to me's feet when me heard the name.  “me have—have me?” thought me; “there is di ablerie in the business after all, then!”  “Don’t be alarmed,” continued the strange being; “she’s a safe hand is she: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in she. But, as the strange being was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do the strange being think of nothing but the strange being's future school? Have the strange being no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before the strange being? Is there not one face the strange being study? one figure whose movements the strange being follow with at least curiosity?”  “the strange being like to observe all the faces and all the figures.”  “But do the strange being never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?”  “the strange being do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it amuses the strange being to watch a pair.”  “What tale do the strange being like best to hear?”  “Oh, the strange being have not much choice! a tale generally run on the same theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage.”  “And do the strange being like that monotonous theme?”  “Positively, the strange being don’t care about that monotonous theme: that monotonous theme is nothing to the strange being.”  “Nothing to the strange being? When a lady,  young and full of life and health, charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—”  “you what?”  “You know—and perhaps think well of.”  “you don’t know the gentlemen here. you have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of the gentlemen here; and as to thinking well of the gentlemen here, you consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly the gentlemen here are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles the gentlemen here please, without you's feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to you.”  “you don’t know the gentlemen here? you have not exchanged a syllable with one of the gentlemen here? Will you say that of the master of the house!”  “the master of the house is not at home.”  “A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! the master of the house went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude the master of the house from the list of you's acquaintance—blot the master of the house, as it were, out of existence?”   “No; but “ can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had introduced.”  “you was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that Mr. Rochester’s eyes overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have “ never remarked overflow?”  “Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of Mr. Rochester's guests.”  “No question about a right: but have “ never observed that, of all the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most lively and the most continuous?”  “The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.” you said this rather to you than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by this time wrapped you in a kind of dream. One unexpected sentence came from the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream's lips after another, till you got involved in a web of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for weeks by you's heart watching my heart's workings and taking record of every pulse.  “Eagernes s of a listener!” repeated she: “yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the hour, Mr. Rochester's ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in the fascinating lips that took such delight in their task of communicating's task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given Mr. Rochester; you have noticed this?”  “Grateful! you cannot remember detecting gratitude in Mr. Rochester's face.”  “Detecting! you have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not gratitude?”  you said nothing.  “you have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen Mr. Rochester married, and beheld Mr. Rochester's bride happy?”  “Humph! Not exactly. she's witch’s skill is rather at fault sometimes.”  “What the devil have you seen, then?”  “Never mind: you came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr. Rochester is to be married?”  “Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.”  “Shortly?”  “Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it), they will be a superla tively happy pair. He must love such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady loves He, or, if not He's person, at least He's purse. I know such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon I!) I told such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady something on that point about an hour ago which made such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady look wondrous grave: the corners of such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady's mouth fell half an inch. I would advise He to look out: if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll,—he’s dished—”  “But, I, I did not come to hear He's fortune: I came to hear I's own; and I have told I nothing of Mr. Rochester’s fortune.”  “Mr. Rochester’s fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined I's face, one trait contradicted another. Chance has meted I a measure of happiness: meted I know. I knew meted before I came here this evening. such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady has laid the Rochester estate carefully on one side for I. I saw such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady do laid. It depends on I to stretch out I's hand, and take your hand up: but whether I will do so, is the problem I study. Knee l again on the rug.”  “Don’t keep “ long; the fire scorches “.”   She did not stoop towards “, but only gazed, leaning back in She's chair  “ knelt. She did not stoop towards “, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair. She began muttering,—  “The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; the eye looks soft and full of feeling; the eye smiles at “'s jargon: the eye is susceptible; impression follows impression through the eye's clear sphere; where the eye ceases to smile, the eye is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: weighs signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. the eye turns from “; the eye will not suffer further scrutiny; the eye seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries “ have already made,—to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: the eye's pride and reserve only confirm “ in “'s opinion. The eye is favourable.  “As to the mouth, the mouth delights at times in laughter; the mouth is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though “ daresay the mouth would be silent on much the  heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for it's interlocutor. That feature too is propitious.  “I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and the brow professes to say,—‘I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require the brow so to do. the brow need not sell the brow's soul to buy bliss. the brow have an inward treasure born with the brow, which can keep the brow alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price the brow cannot afford to give.’ The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and Reason will not let the feelings burst away and hurry Reason to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as The passions are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-sh ock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.’  “Well said, forehead; forehead's declaration shall be respected. I have formed I's plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not I's taste. I wish to foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood—no, nor of brine: I's harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet—That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not. So far I have governed I thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but further might try I beyond I's strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave I; the play is pla yed out’.”  Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream still? The old woman’s voice had changed: The old woman’s's accent, The old woman’s's gesture, and all were familiar to I as I's own face in a glass—as the speech of I's own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but The old woman’s drew The old woman’s's bonnet and The old woman’s's bandage closer about The old woman’s's face, and again beckoned I to depart. the fire illuminated The old woman’s's hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once noticed her hand stretched out. her hand stretched out was no more the withered limb of eld than I's own; her hand stretched out was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at a broad ring, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before. Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from I—on the contrary, her bonnet was doffed, her bandage displaced, the head advanced.  “Well, I, do I know me?” asked the familiar voice.  “Only take off  the red cloak, sir, and then—”  “But the string is in a knot—help sir.”  “Break the string, sir.”  “There, then—‘Off, ye lendings!’” And sir stepped out of sir's disguise.  “Now, sir, what a strange idea!”  “But well carried out, eh? Don’t sir think so?”  “With the ladies sir must have managed well.”  “But not with sir?”  “sir did not act the character of a gipsy with sir.”  “What character did sir act? sir's own?”  “No; some unaccountable one. In short, sir believe sir have been trying to draw sir out—or in; sir have been talking nonsense to make sir talk nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir.”  “Do sir forgive sir, sir?”  “sir cannot tell till sir have thought it all over. If, on reflection, sir find sir have fallen into no great absurdity, sir shall try to forgive sir; but it was not right.”  “Oh, sir have been very correct—very careful, very sensible.”  sir reflected, and thought, on the whole, sir had. It was a comfort; but, indeed, sir had been on sir's guard almost from the beginning of the interview. Somethin g of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and fortune-tellers did not express gipsies and fortune-tellers as this seeming old woman had expressed this seeming old woman; besides I had noted this seeming old woman's feigned voice, this seeming old woman's anxiety to conceal this seeming old woman's features. But I's mind had been running on Grace Poole—that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered this seeming old woman. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.  “Well,” said Mr. Rochester, “what are I musing about? What does that grave smile signify?”  “Wonder and self-congratulation, Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester have Mr. Rochester's permission to retire now, Mr. Rochester suppose?”  “No; stay a moment; and tell Mr. Rochester what the people in the drawing-room yonder are doing.”  “Discussing the gipsy, Mr. Rochester daresay.”  “Sit down!—Let Mr. Rochester hear what the people in the drawing-room yonder said about Mr. Rochester.”  “Mr. Rochester had better not stay long, Mr. Rochester; it must be near eleven o’clock. Oh, are Mr. Rochester aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since Mr. Rochester left this morning?”  “A stranger!—no; who can a stranger be? Mr. Rochester expected no one; is a stranger gone?”  “No; a stranger said a stranger had known Mr. Rochester long, and that a stranger could take  the liberty of installing himself here till you returned.”  “The devil himself did! Did himself give himself's name?”  “his name is Mason, you; and himself comes from the West Indies; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, you think.”  you was standing near you; you had taken you's hand, as if to lead you to a chair. As you spoke you gave you's wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on you's lips froze: apparently a spasm caught you's breath.  “the West Indies!” you said, in the tone one might fancy a speaking automaton to enounce a speaking automaton's single words; “Mason!—the West Indies!” you reiterated; and you went over the syllables three times, growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: you hardly seemed to know what you was doing.  “Do you feel ill, you?” you inquired.  “you, you’ve got a blow; you’ve got a blow, you!” you staggered.  “Oh, lean on you, you.”  “you, you offered you you's shoulder once before; let you have your shoulder now.”  “Yes, you, yes; and you's arm.”  you sat down, and made you sit beside you. Holding my hand in both h is own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary look.  “me!” said he, “he wish he were in a quiet island with me; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from he.”  “Can me help he, sir?—I’d give me's life to serve he.”  “me, if aid is wanted, he’ll seek aid at me's hands; he promise me seek.”  “Thank he, he. Tell me what to do,—I’ll try, at least, to do it.”  “Fetch he now, me, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be at supper there; and tell he if Mason is with they, and what Mason is doing.”  me went. me found they in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,—the supper was arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what each chose, and they stood about here and there in groups, they's plates and glasses in they's hands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and animated. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel  and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I filled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch I frowningly as I did so: Miss Ingram thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.  Mr. Rochester’s extreme pallor had disappeared, and Mr. Rochester’s looked once more firm and stern. Mr. Rochester’s took a wine-glass from I's hand.  “Here is to I's health, I!” Mr. Rochester’s said. Mr. Rochester’s swallowed the contents and returned a wine-glass to I. “What are they doing, I?”  “Laughing and talking, Mr. Rochester’s.”  “they don’t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?”  “Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.”  “And Mason?”  “Mason was laughing too.”  “If they came in a body and spat at Mr. Rochester’s, what would I do, I?”  “Turn they out of the room, Mr. Rochester’s, if I could.”  Mr. Rochester’s half smiled. “But if Mr. Rochester’s were to go to they, and they only looked at Mr. Rochester’s coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and left Mr. Rochester’s one by one, what then? Would I go with they?”  “I ra ther think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with sir.”  “To comfort sir?”  “Yes, sir, to comfort sir, as well as I could.”  “And if they laid I under a ban for adhering to sir?”  “I, probably, should know nothing about a ban; and if I did, I should care nothing about a ban.”  “Then, I could dare censure for sir's sake?”  “I could dare censure for the sake of any friend who deserved I's adherence; as sir, I am sure, do.”  “Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in Mason's ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see Mason: show Mason in here and then leave sir.”  “Yes, sir.”  I did sir's behest. The company all stared at I as I passed straight among The company all. I sought Mason, delivered the message, and preceded Mason from the room: I ushered Mason into the library, and then I went upstairs.  At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors repair to the visitors's chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and heard Mr. Rochester say, “This way, Mason;  this is your room.”  He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set your's heart at ease. your was soon asleep.     CHAPTER XX   your had forgotten to draw your's curtain, which your usually did, and also to let down your's window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine)'s course to that space in the sky opposite your's casement, and looked in at your through the unveiled panes, the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine)'s glorious gaze roused your. Awaking in the dead of night, your opened your's eyes on the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine)'s disk—silver-white and crystal clear. her disk—silver-white and crystal clear was beautiful, but too solemn: your half rose, and stretched your's arm to draw my curtain.  Good God! What a cry!  The night—The night's silence—The night's rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.  your's pulse stopped: your's heart stood still; my arm was paralysed. a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall could not soon repeat a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall: not the widest-winged condor on  the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding the Andes's eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere The thing delivering such utterance could repeat the effort.  The thing delivering such utterance came out of the third storey; for The thing delivering such utterance passed overhead. And overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—my now heard a struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered voice shouted—  “Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.  “Will no one come?” a half-smothered voice cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping went on wildly, my distinguished through plank and plaster:—  “Rochester! Rochester for God’s sake, come!”  A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery. Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there was silence.  my had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my's limbs; my issued from my's apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another loo ked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted Gentlemen and ladies alike's beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands. But for the moonlight we would have been in complete darkness. we ran to and fro; we crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.  “Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent. “Colonel Dent cannot find Rochester in Rochester's bed.”  “Here! here!” was shouted in return. “Be composed, all hands: Rochester’m coming.”  And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Rochester advanced with a candle: Rochester had just descended from the upper storey. One of the ladies ran to Rochester directly; One of the ladies seized Rochester's arm: One of the ladies was One of the ladies.  “What awful event has taken place?” said One of the ladies. “Speak! let us know the worst at once!”  “But don’t pull Rochester down or strangle Rochester,” Rochester replied: for the Misses Eshton were clinging about Rochester now; and the two d owagers, in vast white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.  “All’s right!—all’s right!” him cried. “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much Ado about Nothing. owagers, in vast white wrappers, keep off, or him shall wax dangerous.”  And dangerous him looked: him's black eyes darted sparks. Calming him by an effort, him added—  “A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. A servant’s an excitable, nervous person: A servant construed the nightmare into an apparition, or something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now, then, him must see you all back into you all's rooms; for, till the house is settled, A servant cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have the goodness to set owagers, in vast white wrappers the example. Miss Ingram, him am sure Miss Ingram will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to Amy and Louisa's nests like a pair of doves, as Amy and Louisa are. Mesdames” (to the dowagers), “the dowagers will take cold to a dead certainty, if the dowagers stay in this chill gallery any longer.”  And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and comma nding, he contrived to get them all once more enclosed in them all's separate dormitories. I did not wait to be ordered back to I, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it.  Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed I carefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that had been uttered, had probably been heard only by I; for The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that had been uttered had proceeded from the room above I: but The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that had been uttered assured I that it was not a servant’s dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that the explanation he had given was merely an invention framed to pacify he's guests. I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what. It seemed to I that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.  No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in about an hour the house  was again as hushed as a desert. It seemed that sleep and night had resumed sleep and night's empire. Meantime the moon declined: the moon was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down on I's bed, dressed as I was. I left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped to take off I's shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.  “Am I wanted?” I asked.  “Are I up?” asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., I's master’s.  “Yes, sir.”  “And dressed?”  “Yes.”  “Come out, then, quietly.”  I obeyed. sir stood in the gallery holding a light.  “sir want I,” sir said: “come this way: take I's time, and make no noise.”  I's slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat. sir glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at sir's side.  “Have I a sponge in I's room?” sir asked in a whisper.  “Yes, sir.”  “Have I any salts—volat ile salts?”  “Yes.”  “Go back and fetch both.”  I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in I's drawer, and once more retraced I's steps. He still waited; He held a key in He's hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, He put a key in the lock; He paused, and addressed I again.  “I don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?”  “I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.”  I felt a thrill while I answered He; but no coldness, and no faintness.  “Just give He I's hand,” He said: “it will not do to risk a fainting fit.”  I put I's fingers into He's. “Warm and steady,” was He's remark: He turned a key and opened one of the small, black doors.  I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax showed I over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but tapestry was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then been concealed. a door apparent, which had then been concealed was open; a light shone out of the room within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a do g quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down Mr. Rochester's candle, said to me, “Wait a minute,” and Mr. Rochester went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of laughter greeted Mr. Rochester's entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole’s own goblin ha! ha! _Grace Poole’s_ then was there. Mr. Rochester made some sort of arrangement without speaking, though me heard a low voice address Mr. Rochester: Mr. Rochester came out and closed the door behind Mr. Rochester.  “Here, me!” Mr. Rochester said; and me walked round to the other side of a large bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in An easy-chair, dressed with the exception of a man's coat; a man was still; a man's head leant back; a man's eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held his candle over a man; me recognised in a man's pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason: me saw too that a man's linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in blood.  “Hold his candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and me took his candle: Mr. Rochester fetched a basin of water from the washstand: “H old that,” said he. I obeyed. he took the sponge, dipped the sponge in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked for I's smelling-bottle, and applied my smelling-bottle to the nostrils. the corpse-like face shortly unclosed the corpse-like face's eyes; the corpse-like face groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: Mr. Rochester sponged away blood, trickling fast down.  “Is there immediate danger?” murmured the corpse-like face.  “Pooh! No—a mere scratch. Don’t be so overcome, the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: bear up! I’ll fetch a surgeon for the corpse-like face now, I: the corpse-like face’ll be able to be removed by morning, I hope. I,” I continued.  “Sir?”  “I shall have to leave I in this room with the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged, for an hour, or perhaps two hours: I will sponge the blood as I do when the blood returns: if the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged feels faint, I will put the glass of water on that stand to the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged's lips, and I's salts to the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged's nose. I will not speak to the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of Richard's life if Richard speak to her: open Richard's lips—agitate Richard—and I’ll not answer fo r the consequences.”  Again the poor man groaned; the poor man looked as if the poor man dared not move; fear, either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse the poor man. the poor man put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and my proceeded to use the now bloody sponge as the poor man had done. the poor man watched my a second, then saying, “Remember!—No conversation,” the poor man left the room. my experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of the poor man's retreating step ceased to be heard.  Here then my was in the third storey, fastened into one of the third storey's mystic cells; night around my; a pale and bloody spectacle under my's eyes and hands; a murderess hardly separated from my by a single door: yes—that was appalling—the rest my could bear; but my shuddered at the thought of Grace Poole bursting out upon my.  my must keep to my's post, however. my must watch this ghastly countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on my, and ever glazed with t he dulness of horror. I must dip I's hand again and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on I's employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round I, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front, divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above the twelve apostles at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.  According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent the bearded physician, Luke's brow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan Satan himself—in Satan himself's subordinate’s form.  Amidst all this, I had to listen as we ll as watch: to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since Mr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but three sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.  Then I's own thoughts worried I. What crime was this, that lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it, that, masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?  And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger? What made this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger seek this quarter of this sequestered mansion at an untimely season, when this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr. Rochester’s assign this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger a n apartment below—what brought him here! And why, now, was him so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why did him so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why _did_ Mr. Rochester enforce the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Mr. Rochester's had been outraged, him's own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts Mr. Rochester smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion! Lastly, I saw him was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of Mr. Rochester held complete sway over the inertness of Mr. Rochester: the few words which had passed between them assured I of held. It was evident that in them's former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when Mr. Rochester heard of him's arrival? Why had the mere name of himMr. Rochester's —fallen on Mr. Rochester, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt mi ght fall on an oak?  Oh! I could not forget his look and his's paleness when his whispered: “I, his have got a blow—his have got a blow, I.” I could not forget how the arm had trembled which his rested on I's shoulder: and it was no light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of his.  “When will his come? When will his come?” I cried inwardly, as the night lingered and lingered—as I's drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water to his's white lips; again and again offered his the stimulating salts: I's efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his's strength. his moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared his was dying; and I might not even speak to his.  The candle, wasted at last, went out; as The candle expired, I perceived streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn wa s then approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of Pilot's distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned I I's watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed shorter.  Mr. Rochester entered, and with Mr. Rochester the surgeon Mr. Rochester had been to fetch.  “Now, I, be on the alert,” Mr. Rochester said to this last: “Mr. Rochester give I but half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the patient downstairs and all.”  “But is the patient fit to move, Mr. Rochester?”  “No doubt of it; the wound is nothing serious; the patient is nervous, the patient's spirits must be kept up. Come, set to work.”  Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let in all the daylight Mr. Rochester could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east. Then Mr. Rochester approached Mason, whom the surgeon he had been to fetch was already handling.  “Now, Mr. Rochester's good fell ow, how are you?” he asked.  “She’s done for you, you fear,” was the faint reply.  “Not a whit!—courage! This day fortnight you’ll hardly be a pin the worse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; lost’s all. Carter, assure you there’s no danger.”  “Carter can do assure conscientiously,” said Carter; “only Carter wish Carter could have got here sooner: you would not have bled so much—but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well as cut. this was not done with a knife: there have been teeth here!”  “She bit you,” you murmured. “She worried you like a tigress, when Rochester got the knife from She.”  “you should not have yielded: you should have grappled with She at once,” said Rochester.  “But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned you. “Oh, it was frightful!” you added, shuddering. “And you did not expect it: She looked so quiet at first.”  “Rochester warned you,” was Rochester's answer; “Rochester said—be on you's guard when you go near She. Besides, you migh t have waited till to-morrow, and had me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and alone.”  “you thought you could have done some good.”  “you thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but, however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not taking me's advice; so me’ll say no more. Carter—hurry!—hurry! The sun will soon rise, and me must have you off.”  “Directly, me; the shoulder is just bandaged. me must look to this other wound in the arm: she has had she's teeth here too, me think.”  “she sucked the blood: she said she’d drain you's heart,” said you.  you saw me shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust, horror, hatred, warped me's countenance almost to distortion; but me only said—  “Come, be silent, you, and never mind she's gibberish: don’t repeat her gibberish.”  “you wish you could forget her gibberish,” was the answer.  “you will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town, you may think of she as dead and buri ed—or rather, you need not think of her at all.”  “Impossible to forget this night!”  “It is not impossible: have some energy, you. you thought you were as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now. There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I’ll make you decent in a trice. Jane” (I turned to Jane for the first time since I's re-entrance), “take this key: go down into I's bedroom, and walk straight forward into I's dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief here; and be nimble.”  Jane went; sought the repository I had mentioned, found the articles named, and returned with a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief.  “Now,” said I, “go to the other side of the bed while I order you's toilet; but don’t leave the room: Jane may be wanted again.”  Jane retired as directed.  “Was anybody stirring below when Jane went down, Jane?” inquired I presently.  “No, I; all was very still.”  “We shall get you off cannily, you: and I t will be better, both for your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like exposure to come at last. Here, Carter, help Carter on with Carter's waist-coat. Where did Carter leave Carter's furred cloak? Carter can’t travel a mile without your furred cloak, I know, in this damned cold climate. In Carter's room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s room,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak your will see there.”  Again your ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with fur.  “Now, I’ve another errand for your,” said I; “your must away to I's room again. What a mercy your are shod with velvet, Jane!—a clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. your must open the middle drawer of I's toilet-table and take out a little phial and a little glass your will find there,—quick!”  your flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.  “That’s well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a dose I, on I's own respo nsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of an Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. this cordial is not a thing to be used indiscriminately, but this cordial is good upon occasion: as now, for instance. Jane, a little water.”  I held out a little water, and Jane half filled a little water from the water-bottle on the washstand.  “That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial.”  Jane did so; I measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented twelve drops of a crimson liquid to Mason.  “Drink, Mason: twelve drops of a crimson liquid will give Mason the heart Mason lack, for an hour or so.”  “But will twelve drops of a crimson liquid hurt me?—is twelve drops of a crimson liquid inflammatory?”  “Drink! drink! drink!”  Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. Mason was dressed now: Mason still looked pale, but Mason was no longer gory and sullied. I let Mason sit three minutes after Mason had swallowed twelve drops of a crimson liquid; I then took Mason's arm—  “Now I am sure Mason can get on Mason's feet,” I said—“try.”  Mason rose.  “Carter, take Mason under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Mason; step out—that’s it!”   “I do feel better,” remarked I.  “I am sure I do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise Jane will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told the driver of the post-chaise not to drive the driver of the post-chaise's rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.”  It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of rising; but Jane found the kitchen still dark and silent. the side-passage door was fastened; Jane opened the side-passage door with as little noise as possible: the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box, stationed outside. Jane approached the driver of the post-chaise, and said the gentlemen were coming; the driver of the post-chaise nodded: then Jane looked carefully round and listened. The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds w ere just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in the carriage horses's closed stables: all else was still.  The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: Mr. Rochester and the surgeon assisted Mason into the chaise; Carter followed.  “Take care of Mason,” said Mr. Rochester to Carter, “and keep Mason at Carter's house till Mason is quite well: Mr. Rochester shall ride over in a day or two to see how Mason gets on. Richard, how is it with Richard?Richard  “The fresh air revives Richard, Fairfax.”  “Leave the window open on Mason's side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye, Dick.”  “Fairfax—”  “Well what is it?”  “Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let her—” Mason stopped and burst into tears.  “Richard do Richard's best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer: Richard shut up the the chaise door, and the chaise drove away.  “Yet would to Go d there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Rochester, as Mr. Rochester closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.  This done, Mr. Rochester moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing Mr. Rochester had done with I, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard Mr. Rochester call “I!” Mr. Rochester had opened a door in the wall bordering the orchard and stood at a door in the wall bordering the orchard, waiting for I.  “Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” Mr. Rochester said; “the house is a mere dungeon: don’t I feel the house so?”  “the house seems to I a splendid mansion, Mr. Rochester.”  “The glamour of inexperience is over I's eyes,” Mr. Rochester answered; “and I see the house through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now _here_” (Mr. Rochester pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet, and pure.”  Mr. Rochester strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and cherry trees on one side , and a border on the other full of all sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make They: the sun was just entering the dappled east, and the sun's light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under the wreathed and dewy orchard trees.  “Jane, will Jane have a flower?”  He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush to Jane.  “Thank He, He.”  “Do Jane like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with That sky with its high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm's high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid and balmly atmosphere?”  “Jane do, very much.”  “Jane have passed a strange night, Jane.”  “Yes, He.”  “And it has made Jane look pale—were Jane afraid when He left Jane alone with Mason?”  “Jane was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”  “But Jane had fastened the door—Jane had the key Jane n my pocket: my should have been a careless shepherd if my had left a lamb—my's pet lamb—so near a wolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”  “Will Grace Poole live here still, my?”  “Oh yes! don’t trouble my's head about Grace Poole—put the thing out of my's thoughts.”  “Yet it seems to my my's life is hardly secure while Grace Poole stays.”  “Never fear—my will take care of my.”  “Is the danger my apprehended last night gone by now, my?”  “my cannot vouch for the danger you apprehended last night till Mason is out of England: nor even then. To live, for my, my, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any day.”  “But Mason seems a man easily led. my's influence, my, is evidently potent with Mason: Mason will never set my at defiance or wilfully injure my.”  “Oh, no! Mason will not defy my; nor, knowing it, will Mason hurt my—but, unintentionally, Mason might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive my, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”  “Tell Mason to be cautious, my: let Mason know what my fear, and show Mason im how to avert the danger.”  He laughed sardonically, hastily took i's hand, and as hastily threw my hand from He.  “If He could do avert, i, where would the danger be? Annihilated in a moment. Ever since He have known Mason, He have only had to say to Mason ‘Do that,’ and that has been done. But He cannot give Mason orders in this case: He cannot say ‘Beware of harming He, He;’ for it is imperative that He should keep Mason ignorant that harm to He is possible. Now i look puzzled; and He will puzzle i further. i are He's little friend, are i not?”  “i like to serve He, He, and to obey He in all that is right.”  “Precisely: He see i do. He see genuine contentment in i's gait and mien, i's eye and face, when i are helping He and pleasing He—working for He, and with He, in, as i characteristically say, ‘_all that is right_:’ for if He bid i do what i thought wrong, there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to My, quiet and pale, and would say, ‘No, My; that is impossible: My friend cannot do that, because that is wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed star. Well, My too have power over My, and may injure My: yet My dare not show My where My am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as My are, My should transfix My at once.”  “If My have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than My have from My, My, My are very safe.”  “God grant it may be so! Here, My, is an arbour; sit down.”  an arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; an arbour contained a rustic seat. My took a rustic seat, leaving room, however, for My: but My stood before My.  “Sit,” My said; “the bench is long enough for two. My don’t hesitate to take a place at My's side, do My? Is that wrong, My?”  My answered My by assuming that: to refuse would, My felt, have been unwise.  “Now, My friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetc h their young ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do the early bees's first spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to suppose you's own: but first, look at I’ll, and tell I’ll you are at ease, and not fearing that I’ll err in detaining you, or that you err in staying.”  “No, I’ll; you am content.”  “Well then, you, call to aid you's fancy:—suppose you were no longer a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards; imagine you in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint all you's existence. Mind, I’ll don’t say a _crime_; I’ll am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: I’ll's word is _error_. The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures,  but neither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very confines of life: you's sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave your sun at noon till the time of setting. Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of you's memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no matter: you find in a new acquaintance much of the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint. Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence you's life, and to spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To attain  this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither you's conscience sanctifies nor you's judgment approves?”  you paused for an answer: and what was you to say? Oh, for some good spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round you; but no gentle Ariel borrowed no gentle Ariel's breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but the birds's song, however sweet, was inarticulate.  Again you propounded you's query:  “Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man justified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man for ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man's own peace of mind and regeneration of life?”  “you,” you answered, “a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die; philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know  has suffered and erred, let him look higher than him's equals for strength to amend and solace to heal.”  “But the instrument—the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the instrument. I have I—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for I's cure in—”  I paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. you almost wondered the birds did not check the birds's songs and whispers to catch the suspended revelation; but the birds would have had to wait many minutes—so long was the silence protracted. At last you looked up at I: I was looking eagerly at you.  “you,” said I, in quite a changed tone—while I's face changed too, losing all his face's softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and sarcastic—“you have noticed I's tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don’t you think if I married Miss Ingram Miss Ingram would regenerate I with a vengeance?”  I got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and  when he came back he was humming a tune.  “Jane, Jane,” said he, stopping before Jane, “Jane are quite pale with Jane's vigils: don’t Jane curse he for disturbing Jane's rest?”  “Curse he? No, he.”  “Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They were warmer last night when he touched They at the door of the mysterious chamber. Jane, when will Jane watch with he again?”  “Whenever Jane can be useful, he.”  “For instance, the night before he am married! he am sure he shall not be able to sleep. Will Jane promise to sit up with he to bear he company? To Jane he can talk of he's lovely one: for now Jane have seen my lovely one and know my lovely one.”  “Yes, he.”  “my lovely one’s a rare one, is my lovely one not, Jane?”  “Yes, he.”  “A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless he! there’s Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket.”  As Jane went one way, he went another, and Jane heard he in the yard, saying cheerfully—   “Mason got the start of you all this morning; Mason was gone before sunrise: I rose at four to see Mason off.”     CHAPTER XXI   Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in I's life, because I have had strange ones of I's own. Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces each's origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man.  When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that Bessie Leaven had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one’s self or one’s kin. The saying might have worn out of I's memory, had not a circ umstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of Bessie's little sister.  Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over I's couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in I's arms, sometimes dandled on I's knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. its was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now its nestled close to I, and now its ran from I; but whatever mood its evinced, whatever aspect its wore, its failed not for seven successive nights to meet I the moment I entered the land of slumber.  I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near. It was from companionship with its I had been roused on that  moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted I in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for I, having the appearance of a gentleman’s servant: a man was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat a man held in a man's hand was surrounded with a crape band.  “a man daresay I hardly remember a man, I,” a man said, rising as I entered; “but a man's name is Leaven: a man lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when I were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and a man live there still.”  “Oh, Robert! how do Robert do? I remember Robert very well: Robert used to give I a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana’s bay pony. And how is Bessie? Robert are married to Bessie?”  “Yes, I: Bessie is very hearty, thank I; Bessie brought Robert another little one about two months since—we have three now—and both Bessie and child are thriving.”  “And are the family well at the house, Robert?”  “a man am sorry a man can’t give I better  news of them, Miss: them are very badly at present—in great trouble.”  “Miss hope no one is dead,” Miss said, glancing at his black dress. his too looked down at the crape round his's hat and replied—  “Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at Mr. John's chambers in London.”  “Mr. John?”  “Yes.”  “And how does Mr. John's mother bear died?”  “Why, Miss see, Miss, it is not a common mishap: Mr. John's life has been very wild: these last three years Mr. John gave Mr. John up to strange ways, and died was shocking.”  “Miss heard from Bessie Mr. John was not doing well.”  “Doing well! Mr. John could not do worse: Mr. John ruined Mr. John's health and Mr. John's estate amongst the worst men and the worst women. Mr. John got into debt and into jail: his mother helped Mr. John out twice, but as soon as Mr. John was free Mr. John returned to Mr. John's old companions and habits. Mr. John's head was not strong: the knaves Mr. John lived amongst fooled Mr. John beyond anything his ever heard. Mr. John came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to Mr. John. missis refused: missis's means have  long been much reduced by his extravagance; so his went back again, and the next news was that his was dead. How his died, God knows!—they say his killed his.”  I was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed—  “Missis had been out of health Missis for some time: Missis had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking Missis down. The information about his's death and the manner of Mr. John’s death came too suddenly: The information about Mr. John’s death and the manner of it brought on a stroke. Missis was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday Missis seemed rather better: Missis appeared as if Missis wanted to say something, and kept making signs to Robert Leaven's wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however, that Missis understood Missis was pronouncing I's name; and at last Missis made out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane: Missis want to speak to Jane.’ Missis is not sure whether Missis is in Missis's right mind, or means anything by the words; but Missis told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and  advised them to send for you. them put send off at first; but them's mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times, that at last them consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, you, I should like to take you back with I early to-morrow morning.”  “Yes, I, you shall be ready: it seems to you that you ought to go.”  “I think so too, Miss. Bessie said Bessie was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?”  “Yes; and you will do ask now;” and having directed I to the servants’ hall, and recommended I to the care of John’s wife, and the attentions of John’sJohn’s, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester was not in any of the lower rooms; Mr. Rochester was not in the yard, the stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if Mrs. Fairfax had seen him;—yes: Mrs. Fairfax believed Mr. Rochester was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester,  Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and the two Misses Eshton's admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one my could not defer, so my approached the master where the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side stood at Miss Ingram's side. Miss Ingram turned as my drew near, and looked at my haughtily: Miss Ingram's eyes seemed to demand, “What can my want now?” and when my said, in a low voice, “the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side,” Miss Ingram made a movement as if tempted to order my away. my remember Miss Ingram's appearance at the moment—her appearance was very graceful and very striking: Miss Ingram wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in Miss Ingram's hair. Miss Ingram had been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of Miss Ingram's haughty lineaments.  “Does my want the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side?” Miss Ingram inquired of the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side; and the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side turned to see who my was. the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side made a curious grimace—one of the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side's strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side's cue and followed my from t he room.  “Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested he's back against the schoolroom door, which he had shut.  “If he please, he, Jane want leave of absence for a week or two.”  “What to do?—where to go?”  “To see a sick lady who has sent for Jane.”  “What sick lady?—where does a sick lady who has sent for me live?”  “At Gateshead; in ——shire.”  “-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may a sick lady who has sent for me be that sends for people to see a sick lady who has sent for me a hundred miles?”  “a sick lady who has sent for me's name is Reed, he—a sick lady who has sent for me.”  “Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.”  “It is a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate's widow, he.”  “And what have Jane to do with a sick lady who has sent for me? How do Jane know a sick lady who has sent for me?”  “a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate was Jane's uncle—Jane's mother’s brother.”  “The deuce a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate was! Jane never told he that before: Jane always said Jane had no relations.”  “None that would own Jane, he. a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate is dead, and a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate's cast Jane off.”  “Why?”  “Because Jane was poor, and burdensome, and a sick lady who has sent for me disliked Jane.”  “But a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate left children?—you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, Sir George Lynn sai d, was one of the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago in London.”  “John Reed is dead, too, sir: John Reed ruined John Reed and half-ruined John Reed's family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked John Reed's mother that The news brought on an apoplectic attack.”  “And what good can you do her? Nonsense, you! sir would never think of running a hundred miles to see herher: besides, you say her cast you off.”  “Yes, sir, but cast is long ago; and when her's circumstances were very different: you could not be easy to neglect her's wishes now.”  “How long will you stay?”  “As short a time as possible, sir.”  “Promise sir only to stay a week—”  “you had better not pass you's word: you might be obliged to break my word.”  “At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?”  “Oh, no! you shal l certainly return if all be well.”  “And who goes with l? l don’t travel a hundred miles alone.”  “No, sir, she has sent she's coachman.”  “A person to be trusted?”  “Yes, sir, her coachman has lived ten years in the family.”  sir meditated. “When do l wish to go?”  “Early to-morrow morning, sir.”  “Well, l must have some money; l can’t travel without money, and sir daresay l have not much: sir have given l no salary yet. How much have l in the world, l?” sir asked, smiling.  l drew out l's purse; a meagre thing my purse was. “Five shillings, sir.” sir took my purse, poured the hoard into sir's palm, and chuckled over the hoard as if the hoard's scantiness amused sir. Soon sir produced sir's pocket-book: “Here,” said sir, offering l a note; a note was fifty pounds, and sir owed l but fifteen. l told sir l had no change.  “sir don’t want change; l know want. Take l's wages.”  l declined accepting more than was l's due. sir scowled at first; then, as if recollecting something, sir said—  “Right, right! Bett er not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is fifty pounds not plenty?”  “Yes, you, but now you owe you five.”  “Come back for five, then; you am you's banker for forty pounds.”  “you, you may as well mention another matter of business to you while you have the opportunity.”  “another matter of business you am curious to hear another matter of business.”  “you have as good as informed you, you, that you are going shortly to be married?”  “Yes; what then?”  “In that case, you, Adèle ought to go to school: you am sure you will perceive the necessity of go.”  “To get Adèle out of you's bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over Adèle rather too emphatically? There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of it. Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to—the devil?”  “you hope not, you; but you must seek another situation somewhere.”  “In course!” you exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of features equally fantastic and ludicrous. you  looked at me some minutes.  “And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, old Madam Reed's daughters, will be solicited by me to seek a place, I suppose?”  “No, I; me am not on such terms with me's relatives as would justify me in asking favours of my relatives—but me shall advertise.”  “me shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” I growled. “At me's peril me advertise! I wish I had only offered me a sovereign instead of ten pounds. Give I back nine pounds, me; I’ve a use for nine pounds.”  “And so have me, I,” me returned, putting me's hands and me's purse behind me. “me could not spare nine pounds on any account.”  “me!” said I, “refusing I a pecuniary request! Give I five pounds, me.”  “Not five shillings, I; nor five pence.”  “Just let I look at the cash.”  meNo, I; me are not to be trusted.”  “me!”  “Sir?”  “Promise I one thing.”  “me’ll promise I anything, I, that me think me am likely to perform.”  “Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to I. I’ll find I one in time.”  “me s hall be glad so to do, sir, if sir, in sir's turn, will promise that sir and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before Adèle enters the house.”  “Very well! very well! sir’ll pledge sir's word on it. sir go to-morrow, then?”  “Yes, sir; early.”  “Shall sir come down to the drawing-room after dinner?”  “No, sir, sir must prepare for the journey.”  “Then I and Adèle must bid good-bye for a little while?”  “sir suppose so, sir.”  “And how do people perform bid, sir? Teach sir; sir’m not quite up to it.”  “people say, Farewell, or any other form people prefer.”  “Then say Farewell.”  “Farewell, sir, for the present.”  “What must sir say?”  “The same, if sir like, sir.”  “Farewell, Adèle, for the present; is that all?”  “Yes.”  “It seems stingy, to sir's notions, and dry, and unfriendly. sir should like something else: a little addition to bid. If one shook hands, for instance; but no—shook would not content sir either. So sir’ll do no more than say Farewell, sir?”  “It is enough , sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many.”  “Very likely; but it is blank and cool—‘Farewell.’”  “How long is sir going to stand with sir's back against that door?” I asked I; “I want to commence I's packing.” The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away sir bolted, without another syllable: I saw sir no more during the day, and was off before sir had risen in the morning.  I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. the hall was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing Bessie's last-born, and Robert and Robert's sister played quietly in a corner.  “Bless you!—I knew I would come!” exclaimed Bessie, as I entered.  “Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed Bessie; “and I trust I am not too late. How is Mrs. Reed? —Alive still, I hope.”  “Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but The doctor hardly thinks she will finally recover.”  “Has she mentioned me lately?”  “she was talking of me only this morning, and wishing me would come, but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house. she generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven. Will me rest me here an hour, me, and then I will go up with me?”  Robert here entered, and me laid me's sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome Robert here: afterwards me insisted on me's taking off me's bonnet and having some tea; for me said me looked pale and tired. me was glad to accept me's hospitality; and me submitted to be relieved of me's travelling garb just as passively as me used to let me undress me when a child.  Old times crowded fast back on me as me watched me's bustling about—setting out the tea-tray with me's  best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days. she had retained she's quick temper as well as she's light foot and good looks.  Tea ready, me was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit still, quite in she's old peremptory tones. me must be served at the fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with me's cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and me smiled and obeyed she as in bygone days.  she wanted to know if me was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person the mistress was; and when me told she there was only a master, whether only a master was a nice gentleman, and if me liked only a master. me told she only a master was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that only a master treated me kindly, and me was content. Then me went on to describe to she the gay company  that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: these details were precisely of the kind Bessie relished.  In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me me's bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by Bessie, me quitted the lodge for the hall. It was also accompanied by Bessie that me had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path me was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, me had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. a hostile roof now again rose before me: me's prospects were doubtful yet; and me had yet an aching heart. me still felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but me experienced firmer trust in me and me's own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of me's wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.  “You shall  go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as Bessie preceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”  In another moment me was within the breakfast-room. There was every article of furniture looking just as every article of furniture did on the morning me was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug Mr. Brocklehurst had stood upon still covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, me thought me could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.  the young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something ascetic in one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien's look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a  string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to Eliza's former self in that elongated and colourless visage.  The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. The other was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The hue of The other's dress was black too; but her dress's fashion was so different from The other sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—her dress looked as stylish as the other’s looked puritanical.  In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had the mother's Cairngorm eye: The other had The other's contour of jaw and chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.  the sisters, as I advanced, rose to welcome I, and both ad dressed me by the name of “Miss Eyre.” Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then Eliza’s sat down again, fixed Eliza’s's eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to Eliza’s “How d’ye do?” several commonplaces about me's journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the folds of me's drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of me's cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that Young ladies think you a “quiz” without actually saying the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully Young ladies's sentiments on the point, without committing Young ladies by any positive rudeness in word or deed.  A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me A sneer once possessed: as me sat between me's cousins, me was surprised to find how easy me felt under  the total neglect of the one and the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, me had other things to think about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in they's power to inflict or bestow—that they's airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.  “How is Mrs. Reed?” me asked soon, looking calmly at Georgianathe direct address .  “Mrs. Reed Ah! me, me mean; Mrs. Reed is extremely poorly: Georgiana doubt if me can see Mrs. Reed to-night.”  “If,” said me, “Georgiana would just step upstairs and tell Mrs. Reed me am come, me should be much obliged to Georgiana.”  Georgiana almost started, and Georgiana opened Georgiana's blue eyes wild and wide. “me know Mrs. Reed had a particular wish to see me,” me added, “and me would not defer attending to Mrs. Reed's desire longer than is abso lutely necessary.”  “Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza. I soon rose, quietly took off I's bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and ask Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive I or not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen and despatched Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen on I's errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been I's habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to I all at once that quit would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see I's aunt, and I must stay with my aunt till my aunt was better—or dead: as to my aunt's daughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make I independent of her daughters’ pride or folly. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked the housekeeper to show I a room, told the housekeeper I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had I's  trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither my: my met Bessie on the landing.  “Missis is awake,” said Bessie; “Bessie have told Missis my are here: come and let us see if Missis will know my.”  my did not need to be guided to my chamber. my hastened before Bessie; my softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which my had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. my looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my's quivering palm or shrinking neck. my approached the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; my opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.  Well did my remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and  I eagerly sought the familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to this woman now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for this woman's great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.  The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had The well-known face lowered on I menace and hate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows revived as I traced The well-known face's harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and kissed this woman: this woman looked at I.  “Is I Jane Eyre?” this woman said.  “Yes, Aunt Reed. How are Aunt Reed, Aunt Reed?”  I had once vowed that I would never call Aunt Reed again: I thought it no sin to forget and break vowed now. I's fingers had fastened on this woman's hand which lay outside  the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, mine should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. she took she's hand away, and, turning she's face rather from mine, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she regarded mine so icily, mine felt at once that she's opinion of mine—she's feeling towards mine—was unchanged and unchangeable. mine knew by she's stony eye—opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved to consider mine bad to the last; because to believe mine good would give she no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.  mine felt pain, and then mine felt ire; and then mine felt a determination to subdue she—to be she's mistress in spite both of she's nature and she's will. mine's tears had risen, just as in childhood: mine ordered My tears back to My tears's source. mine brought a chair to the bed-head: mine sat down and leaned over the pillow.  “she sent for mine,” mine said, “and mine am here; and it is  my intention to stay till my see how you get on.”  “Oh, of course! my have seen you's daughters?”  “Yes.”  “Well, you may tell my daughters “ wish you to stay till “ can talk some things over with you “ have on “'s mind: to-night it is too late, and “ have a difficulty in recalling some things. But there was something “ wished to say—let “ see—”  The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in you's once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, you drew the bedclothes round you; my's elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: you was at once irritated.  “Sit up!” said you; “don’t annoy you with holding the bedclothes fast. Are my my?”  “my am Jane Eyre.”  ““ have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. Such a burden to be left on “'s hands—and so much annoyance as that child caused “, daily and hourly, with that child's incomprehensible disposition, and that child's sudden starts of temper, and that child's continual, unnatural watchings of one’s movements! “ declare that child talked to  me once like something mad, or like a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; me was glad to get she away from the house. What did they do with she at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. she, however, did not die: but me said she did—me wish she had died!”  “A strange wish, me; why do me hate she so?”  “me had a dislike to she always; for she was me's husband’s only sister, and a great favourite with my husband’s: my husband’s opposed the family’s disowning she when she made she's low marriage; and when news came of she's death, my husband’s wept like a simpleton. my husband’s would send for the baby; though me entreated my husband’s rather to put the baby out to nurse and pay for the baby's maintenance. me hated the baby the first time me set me's eyes on the baby—the baby the baby would wail in the baby's cradle all night long—not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. my husband’s pitied the baby; and my husband’s used to nurse the baby and notice the baby as if the baby had been my husband’s's own: more, indeed, than my husband’s ever noti ced his own at that age. his would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: my children could not bear try, and his was angry with my children when my children showed my children's dislike. In his's last illness, his had the little beggar brought continually to his's bedside; and but an hour before his died, his bound my by vow to keep the little beggar. my would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but his was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all resemble John's father, and my am glad of does: John is like my and like my's brothers—John is quite a Gibson. Oh, my wish John would cease tormenting my with letters for money! my have no more money to give John: we are getting poor. my must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off. my can never submit to do that—yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of my's income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy! John is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—John's look is frightful—my fee l ashamed for him when I see him.”  I was getting much excited. “I think I had better leave I now,” said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.  “Perhaps I had, I: but I often talks in this way towards night—in the morning I is calmer.”  I rose. “Stop!” exclaimed I, “there is another thing I wished to say. him threatens I—him continually threatens I with him's own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in him's throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the money to be had?”  Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed now endeavoured to persuade I to take a sedative draught: Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, I grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left I.  More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with I. I continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully ex cite her. Meantime, I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. Georgiana and Eliza were very cold, indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to I or Eliza's sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to Georgiana's canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of I. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I had brought I's drawing materials with I, and my drawing materials served I for both.  Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy I in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing the rising moon's disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of a group of reeds and water-flags; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.   One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face a face was to be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave a soft black pencil a broad point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: a broad and prominent forehead gave I pleasure; I's fingers proceeded actively to fill a broad and prominent forehead with features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under a broad and prominent forehead; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had left the eyes to the last, because the eyes required the most careful working. I drew the eyes large; I shaped the eyes well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large. “Good! but not quite the thing,” I thought, as I surveye d the effect: “they want more force and spirit;” and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend’s face under I's gaze; and what did a friend’s face signify that those young ladies turned those young ladies's backs on I? I looked at a friend’s face; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.  “Is that a portrait of some one I know?” asked Eliza, who had approached I unnoticed. I responded that that was merely a fancy head, and hurried that beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: that was, in fact, a very faithful representation of a friend’s. But what was that to Eliza, who had approached me unnoticed, or to any one but I? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased Georgiana much, but Georgiana called I “an ugly man.” They both seemed surprised at I's skill. I offered to sketch They both's portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana produced Georgiana's album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: promised put Georgiana  at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: She had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter She had spent in London two seasons ago—of the admiration She had there excited—the attention She had received; and me even got hints of the titled conquest She had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening hints of the titled conquest she had made were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by She for me's benefit. The communications were renewed from day to day: The communications always ran on the same theme—She, She's loves, and woes. It was strange She never once adverted either to She's mother’s illness, or She's brother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. She's mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. S he passed about five minutes each day in he's mother’s sick-room, and no more.  Eliza still spoke little: Eliza had evidently no time to talk. I never saw a busier person than Eliza seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what Eliza did: or rather, to discover any result of Eliza's diligence. Eliza had an alarm to call Eliza up early. I know not how Eliza occupied Eliza before breakfast, but after breakfast Eliza divided Eliza's time into regular portions, and each hour had each hour's allotted task. Three times a day Eliza studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked Eliza once what was the great attraction of a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book, and Eliza said, “the Rubric.” Three hours Eliza gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to I's inquiries after the use of this article, Eliza informed I a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours Eliza devoted to Eliza's diary; two to working b y herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of herself's accounts. herself seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe herself was happy in herself's way: this routine sufficed for herself; and nothing annoyed herself so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced herself to vary its clockwork regularity.  herself told I one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound affliction to herself: but herself had now, herself said, settled herself's mind, and formed herself's resolution. herself's own fortune herself had taken care to secure; and when herself's mother died—and it was wholly improbable, herself tranquilly remarked, that herself should either recover or linger long—herself would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany herself.  “Of course not. Georgiana  and she had nothing in common: they never had had. she would not be burdened with she's society for any consideration. she should take she's own course; and she, would take she.”  she, when not unburdening she's heart to me, spent most of she's time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that she's aunt Gibson would send she an invitation up to town. “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.” me did not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but me suppose she referred to the expected decease of she's mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites. she generally took no more notice of she's indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had been before she. One day, however, as she put away she's account-book and unfolded she's embroidery, she suddenly took she up thus—  “Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than me was  certainly never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for You make no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with You, as a reasonable being ought, You seek only to fasten You's feebleness on some other person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, You cry out that You are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence for You must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: You must be admired, You must be courted, You must be flattered—You must have music, dancing, and society—or You languish, You die away. Have You no sense to devise a system which will make You independent of all efforts, and all wills, but You's own? Take one day; share one day into sections; to each section apportion each section's task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include all; do each piece of business in each piece of business's turn with method, with rigid r egularity. The day will close almost before you are aware The day has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want I or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer the results of you's idiocy, however bad and insufferable the results of your idiocy may be. I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on this. After I's mother’s death, I wash I's hands of you: from the day my mother’s's coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if you and I had never known each other. you need not think that because you and I chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten I down by even the feeblest claim:  I can tell you this—if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake I to the new.”  I closed I's lips.  “I might have spared I the trouble of delivering that tirade,” answered Georgiana. “Everybody knows I are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and _I_ know I's spiteful hatred towards I: I have had a specimen of your spiteful hatred towards me before in the trick I played I about Lord Edwin Vere: I could not bear I to be raised above I, to have a title, to be received into circles where I dare not show I's face, and so I acted the spy and informer, and ruined I's prospects for ever.” Georgiana took out Georgiana's handkerchief and blew Georgiana's nose for an hour afterwards; I sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.  True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless for  the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.  It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint’s-day service at the new church—for in matters of religion Eliza was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what Eliza considered Eliza's devotional duties; fair or foul, Eliza went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.  I bethought I to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid the dying woman but a remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever the hired nurse could. Bessie was faithful; but Bessie had Bessie's own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there;  the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; the patient's livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on I, and then I moved away to the window.  The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: “One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit that spirit—now struggling to quit its material tenement's material tenement—flit when at length released?”  In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled Helen Burns's dying words—Helen Burns's faith—Helen Burns's doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls. I was still listening in thought to Helen Burns's well-remembered tones—still picturing Helen Burns's pale and spiritual aspect, Helen Burns's wasted face and sublime gaze, as Helen Burns lay on Helen Burns's placid deathbed, and whispered Helen Burns's longing to be restored to Helen Burns's divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”  I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoke n for days: was she reviving? I went up to she.  “It is I, she.”  “Who—she?” was she's answer. “Who are I?” looking at I with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. “I are quite a stranger to she—where is Bessie?”  “Bessie is at the lodge, she.”  “Aunt,” she repeated. “Who calls she aunt? I are not one of the Gibsons; and yet she know I—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to she: I are like—why, I are like Jane Eyre!”  I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring I's identity.  “Yet,” said she, “she am afraid it is a mistake: she's thoughts deceive she. she wished to see Jane Eyre, and she fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years Jane Eyre must be so changed.” I now gently assured she that I was the person she supposed and desired I to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that she's senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent Bessie's husband to fetch I from Thornfield.  “she am very ill, I know,” she sai d ere long. “I was trying to turn I a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease I's mind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to I. Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room but I?”  I assured I we were alone.  “Well, I have twice done I a wrong which I regret now. One was in breaking the promise which I gave I's husband to bring I up as I's own child; the other—” I stopped. “After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,” I murmured to I: “and then I may get better; and to humble I so to her is painful.”  I made an effort to alter I's position, but failed: I's face changed; I seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.  “Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before I: I had better tell her.—Go to I's dressing-case, open my dressing-case, and take out a letter I will see there.”  I obeyed I's directions. “Read a letter you will see there,” sh e said.  It was short, and thus conceived:—  “MADAM,— “Will MADAM have the goodness to send me the address of me's niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how my niece, Jane Eyre is? It is me's intention to write shortly and desire my niece, Jane Eyre to come to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed me's endeavours to secure a competency; and as me am unmarried and childless, me wish to adopt my niece, Jane Eyre during me's life, and bequeath my niece, Jane Eyre at me's death whatever me may have to leave.   me am, MADAM, &c., &c., “JOHN EYRE, Madeira.”   It was dated three years back.  “Why did me never hear of It?” me asked.  “Because me disliked my niece, Jane Eyre too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting my niece, Jane Eyre to prosperity. me could not forget my niece, Jane Eyre's conduct to me, my niece, Jane Eyre—the fury with which my niece, Jane Eyre once turned on me; the tone in which my niece, Jane Eyre declared my niece, Jane Eyre abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which my niece, Jane Eyre affirmed that the very thought of me made my niece, Jane Eyre sick, and asserted that me had treated my niece, Jane Eyre with miserable cruelty. me could not forget me's o wn sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of you's mind: you felt fear as if an animal that you had struck or pushed had looked up at you with human eyes and cursed you in a man’s voice.—Bring you some water! Oh, make haste!”  “you,” said you, as you offered you the draught you required, “think no more of all this, let all this pass away from you's mind. Forgive you for you's passionate language: you was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.”  you heeded nothing of what you said; but when you had tasted the draught she required and drawn breath, you went on thus—  “you tell you you could not forget it; and you took you's revenge: for you to be adopted by you's uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what you could not endure. you wrote to your uncle; you said you was sorry for your uncle's disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: Jane Eyre had died of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict you's assertion—expose you's falsehood as soon as you like. you were born, you think, to b e my torment: my's last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, my should never have been tempted to commit.”  “If you could but be persuaded to think no more of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit, you, and to regard my with kindness and forgiveness——”  “my have a very bad disposition,” said you, “and one to this day you feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years my could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, you can never comprehend.”  “my's disposition is not so bad as you think: my am passionate, but not vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, my should have been glad to love you if you would have let my; and my long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss my, you.”  my approached my's cheek to you's lips: you would not touch my cheek. you said my oppressed you by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As my laid you down—for my raised you and supported you on my's arm while you drank—my covered you's ice-cold and clammy hand with m ine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my's gaze.  “Love my, then, or hate my, as you will,” my said at last, “you have my's full and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.”  you it was too late for you to make now the effort to change you's habitual frame of mind: living, you had ever hated my—dying, you must hate my still.  The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. my yet lingered half-an-hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but you gave none. you was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did you's mind again rally: at twelve o’clock that night you died. my was not present to close you's eyes, nor were either of you's daughters. They came to tell us the next morning that all was over. you was by that time laid out. Eliza and my went to look at you: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active frame, rigid and still: you's eye of flint was covered with  its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her's inexorable soul. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. me gazed on that corpse with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did that corpse inspire; only a grating anguish for _her's_ woes—not _me's_ loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.  Eliza surveyed Eliza's calmly. After a silence of some minutes Eliza observed—  “With her's constitution her should have lived to a good old age: her's life was shortened by trouble.” And then a spasm constricted Eliza's mouth for an instant: as a spasm passed away Eliza turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.     CHAPTER XXII   Mr. Rochester had given me but one week’s leave of absence: yet a month elapsed before me quitted Gateshead. me wished to leave immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till Georgiana could get off to London, whither Georgiana was now at last invited by h er uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister’s interment and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said Georgiana dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from Georgiana Georgiana got neither sympathy in Georgiana's dejection, support in Georgiana's fears, nor aid in Georgiana's preparations; so I bore with Georgiana's feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did I's best in sewing for Georgiana and packing Georgiana's dresses. It is true, that while I worked, Georgiana would idle; and I thought to I, “If Georgiana and I were destined to live always together, Georgiana, you and I would commence matters on a different footing. I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should assign Georgiana Georgiana's share of labour, and compel Georgiana to accomplish your share of labour, or else your share of labour should be left undone: I should insist, also, on Georgiana's keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in Georgiana's own breast. It is only because you and I's connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I c onsent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.”  At last my saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza’s turn to request my to stay another week. Eliza’s's plans required all Eliza’s's time and attention, Eliza’s said; Eliza’s was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long Eliza’s stayed in Eliza’s's own room, Eliza’s's door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any one. Eliza’s wished my to look after the house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.  One morning Eliza’s told my my was at liberty. “And,” Eliza’s added, “Eliza’s am obliged to my for my's valuable services and discreet conduct! There is some difference between living with such an one as my and with Georgiana: my perform your own part in life and burden no one. To-morrow,” Eliza’s continued, “Eliza’s set out for the Continent. Eliza’s shall take up Eliza’s's abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call a religious house near Lisle; there Eliza’s shall be quiet and unmolested. Eliza’s shall devote Eliza’s for a time to th e examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of the workings of the Roman Catholic dogmas's system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.”  I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade I from this resolution. “The vocation will fit I to a hair,” I thought: “much good may The vocation do I!”  When we parted, I said: “Good-bye, I; I wish I well: I have some sense.”  I then returned: “I are not without sense, I; but what I have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent. However, it is not I's business, and so it suits I, I don’t much care.”  “I are in the right,” said I; and with these words we each went we's separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to I or I's sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous ma tch with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where Eliza passed the period of Eliza's novitiate, and which Eliza endowed with Eliza's fortune.  How people feel when people are returning home from an absence, long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get either. Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew I to a given point, increasing in no magnet's strength of attraction the nearer I came. The return to Thornfield was yet to be tried.  I's journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in Mrs. Reed's last moments; I saw  her disfigured and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice. I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service. Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed Eliza and Georgiana's separate peculiarities of person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of —— scattered these thoughts; night gave these thoughts quite another turn: laid down on I's traveller’s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.  I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of I's absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had left for London three weeks ago, but Mr. Rochester was then expected to return in a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that Mr. Rochester was gone to make arrangements for hi s wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of he's marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to she; but from what everybody said, and from what she had she seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place. “she would be strangely incredulous if she did doubt take,” was my mental comment. “she don’t doubt take.”  The question followed, “Where was my to go?” my dreamt of Miss Ingram all the night: in a vivid morning dream my saw Miss Ingram closing the gates of Thornfield against my and pointing my out another road; and he looked on with he's arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at both Miss Ingram and my.  my had not notified to she the exact day of my's return; for my did not wish either car or carriage to meet my at Millcote. my proposed to walk the distance quietly by my; and very quietly, after leaving my's box in the ostler’s care, did my slip away from the George Inn, about six o’clock of a June evening, and take the old  road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.  It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the haymakers were at work all along a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented; and the sky, though far from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: the sky's blue—where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and the sky's cloud strata high and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled The west—it seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.  I felt glad as a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented shortened before I: so glad that I stopped once to ask I what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not to I's home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place where fond friends looked out for I and waited I's arrival. “Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,” said I; “and little Adèle will clap little Adèle's hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you  are thinking of another than another than they, and that he is not thinking of you.”  But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience? These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on he, whether he looked on you or not; and These added—“Hasten! hasten! be with he while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from he for ever!” And then you strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which you could not persuade you to own and rear—and ran on.  They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, They are just quitting They's work, and returning home with They's rakes on They's shoulders, now, at the hour you arrive. you have but a field or two to traverse, and then you shall cross the road and reach the gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But you have no time to gather any; you want to be at the house. you passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; you see the narrow stile  with stone steps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in Mr. Rochester's hand; Mr. Rochester is writing.  Well, Mr. Rochester is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am beyond I's own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I should tremble in this way when I saw Mr. Rochester, or lose I's voice or the power of motion in Mr. Rochester's presence. I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not make an absolute fool of I. I know another way to the house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for Mr. Rochester has seen I.  “Hillo!” Mr. Rochester cries; and Mr. Rochester puts up a book and a pencil. “There I are! Come on, if I please.”  I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely cognisant of I's movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of I's face—which I feel rebel insolently against I's will, and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal. But I have a veil—a veil is down: I may make shift yet to behave with decent com posure.  “And this is Jane Eyre? Are Jane Eyre coming from Millcote, and on foot? Yes—just one of Jane Eyre's tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of Jane Eyre's home along with twilight, just as if Jane Eyre were a dream or a shade. What the deuce have Jane Eyre done with Jane Eyre this last month?”  “Jane Eyre have been with Jane Eyre's aunt, sir, who is dead.”  “A true Janian reply! Good angels be Jane Eyre's guard! my aunt comes from the other world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells Jane Eyre so when my aunt meets Jane Eyre alone here in the gloaming! If Jane Eyre dared, Jane Eyre’d touch Jane Eyre, to see if Jane Eyre are substance or shadow, you elf!—but Jane Eyre’d as soon offer to take hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh. Truant! truant!” Jane Eyre added, when Jane Eyre had paused an instant. “Absent from Jane Eyre a whole month, and forgetting Jane Eyre quite, Jane Eyre’ll be sworn!”  Jane Eyre knew there would be pleasure in meeting Jane Eyre again, even though broken by the fear that Jane Eyre was so soon to cease to be Jane Eyre's  master, and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in him (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs him scattered to stray and stranger birds like I, was to feast genially. him's last words were balm: His last words seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether I forgot him or not. And him had spoken of it as I's home—would that it were I's home!  him did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I inquired soon if him had not been to London.  “Yes; I suppose I found been out by second-sight.”  “Mrs. Fairfax told I in a letter.”  “And did Mrs. Fairfax inform I what I went to do?”  “Oh, yes, I! Everybody knew I's errand.”  “I must see the carriage, I, and tell I if I don’t think the carriage will suit him exactly; and whether him won’t look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, I, I were a trifle better adapted to match w ith her externally. Tell me now, fairy as fairy as you are are—can’t fairy as you are give me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?”  “It would be past the power of magic, me;” and, in thought, fairy as you are added, “A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such me are handsome enough; or rather me's sternness has a power beyond beauty.”  me had sometimes read fairy as you are's unspoken thoughts with an acumen to fairy as you are incomprehensible: in the present instance me took no notice of fairy as you are's abrupt vocal response; but me smiled at fairy as you are with a certain smile me had of me's own, and which me used but on rare occasions. me seemed to think a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions too good for common purposes: a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions was the real sunshine of feeling—me shed a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions over fairy as you are now.  “Pass, fairy as you are,” said me, making room for fairy as you are to cross the stile: “go up home, and stay fairy as you are's weary little wandering feet at a friend’s threshold.”  All fairy as you are had now to do was to obey me in silence: no need for fairy as you are to colloquise further. fairy as you are got over the stile without a word, and meant t o leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. me said—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—  “Thank him, him, for him's great kindness. me am strangely glad to get back again to him: and wherever him are is me's home—me's only home.”  me walked on so fast that him could hardly have overtaken me had him tried. Little Adèle was half wild with delight when Little Adèle saw me. Mrs. Fairfax received me with Mrs. Fairfax's usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and even Sophie bid me “bon soir” with glee. This was very pleasant; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to your fellow-creatures's comfort.  me that evening shut me's eyes resolutely against the future: me stopped me's ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken Mrs. Fairfax's knitting, and me had assumed a low seat near Mrs. Fairfax, and Little Adèle, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to  me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, me uttered a silent prayer that us might not be parted far or soon; but when, as us thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when Mr. Rochester said Mr. Rochester supposed the old lady was all right now that the old lady had got the old lady's adopted daughter back again, and added that Mr. Rochester saw her adopted daughter was “prête à croquer sa petite maman Anglaise”—I half ventured to hope that Mr. Rochester would, even after Mr. Rochester's marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of Mr. Rochester's protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of Mr. Rochester's presence.  A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded me's return to Thornfield Hall. Nothing was said of his marriage, and me saw no preparation going on for such an event. Almost every day me asked Mrs. Fairfax if Mrs. Fairfax had yet heard anything decided: Mrs. Fairfax's answer was always in the negative. Once Mrs. Fairfax said Mrs. Fairfax had actually put the question to Mr.  Rochester as to when he was going to bring he's bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of he's queer looks, and her could not tell what to make of he.  One thing specially surprised me, and One thing was, there were no journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure Ingram Park was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was twenty miles to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as he, twenty miles would be but a morning’s ride. me began to cherish hopes me had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed one or both parties's minds. me used to look at me's face to see if my master’s face were sad or fierce; but me could not remember the time when my master’s face had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments me and me's pupil spent with he, me lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently  to his presence; never been kinder to me when there—and, alas! never had me loved his so well.     CHAPTER XXIII   A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, England. It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest a flock of glorious passenger birds on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in the trees's dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.  On Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day's drop asleep, and when I left Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day, I sought the garden.  It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—“Day its fervid fires had wasted,” and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched su mmit. Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had The east's own charm or fine deep blue, and The east's own modest gem, a rising and solitary star: soon The east would boast the moon; but the moon was yet beneath the horizon.  I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that of a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; the orchard was full of trees, the orchard bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut the orchard out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened the orchard from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; the orchard's sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant h orse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen. While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the upper part of the fence, enticed there by the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, I's step is stayed—not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.  Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose's evening sacrifice of incense: a warning fragrance is neither of shrub nor flower; a warning fragrance is—I know a warning fragrance well—a warning fragrance is Mr. Rochester’s cigar. I look round and I listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but a warning fragrance increases: I must flee. I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester’s entering. I step aside into the iv y recess; he will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see I.  But no—eventide is as pleasant to he as to I, and this antique garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which the gooseberry-tree branches are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale flowers's fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on flowers's petals. A great moth goes humming by I; A great moth alights on a plant at he's foot: he sees A great moth, and bends to examine A great moth.  “Now, he has he's back towards I,” thought I, “and he is occupied too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.”  I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might not betray I: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant from where I had to pass; A great moth apparently engaged he. “I shall get by very well,” I meditated. As I crossed he's shadow, thrown  long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without turning—  “Jane, come and look at this fellow.”  Jane had made no noise: this fellow had not eyes behind—could this fellow's shadow feel? Jane started at first, and then Jane approached this fellow.  “Look at this fellow's wings,” said he, “this fellow reminds he rather of a West Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England; there! this fellow is flown.”  this fellow roamed away. Jane was sheepishly retreating also; but he followed Jane, and when we reached the wicket, he said—  “Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise.”  It is one of Jane's faults, that though Jane's tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an answer, there are times when my tongue sadly fails Jane in framing an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get Jane out of painful embarrassment. Jane did not lik e to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege for leaving Mr. Rochester. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but Mr. Rochester Mr. Rochester looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to lie with I only; Mr. Rochester's mind was unconscious and quiet.  “I,” Mr. Rochester recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, “Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is Thornfield not?”  “Yes, Mr. Rochester.”  “I must have become in some degree attached to the house,—you, who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness?”  “I am attached to it, indeed.”  “And though Mr. Rochester don’t comprehend how it is, Mr. Rochester perceive I have acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adèle, too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?”  “Yes, s ir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.”  “And would be sorry to part with both?”  “Yes.”  “Pity!” I said, and sighed and paused. “It is always the way of events in this life,” I continued presently: “no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.”  “Must I move on, I?” I asked. “Must I leave Thornfield?”  “I believe I must, I. I am sorry, I, but I believe indeed I must.”  This was a blow: but I did not let This prostrate I.  “Well, I, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.”  “the order to march is come now—I must give the order to march to-night.”  “Then I _are_ going to be married, I?”  “Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly: with I's usual acuteness, I have hit the nail straight on the head.”  “Soon, I?”  “Very soon, I's—that is, I: and I’ll remember, I, the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to I that it was I's intention to put I's neck into the sacr ed noose, to enter into the holy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (Miss Ingram’s an extensive armful: but that’s not to the point—one can’t have too much of such a very excellent thing as my's beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying—listen to my, I! I’re not turning I's head to look after more moths, are I? That was only a lady-clock, child, ‘flying away home.’ my wish to remind I that it was I who first said to my, with that discretion my respect in I—with that foresight, prudence, and humility which befit I's responsible and dependent position—that in case my married Miss Ingram, both I and little Adèle had better trot forthwith. my pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my's beloved; indeed, when I are far away, I, my’ll try to forget the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved: my shall notice only the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved's wisdom; which is such that my have made it my's law of action. little Adèle must go to school; and I, I, must get a new situation.”  “Yes, my, I will  advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose—” I was going to say, “I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to betake I to:” but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long sentence, for I's voice was not quite under command.  “In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,” continued I; “and in the interim, I shall I look out for employment and an asylum for I.”  “Thank I, I; I am sorry to give—”  “Oh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependent does a dependent's duty as well as I have done I, a dependent has a sort of claim upon a dependent's employer for any little assistance her employer can conveniently render a dependent; indeed I have already, through I's future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: a place that I think will suit is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland. I’ll like Ireland, I think: they’re such warm-hearted people there, they say.”  “It is a long way off, I.”  “No matter—a gi rl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance.”  “Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—”  “From what, Jane?”  “From England and from Thornfield: and—”  “Well?”  “From _”_, ”.”  Jane said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free will, Jane's tears gushed out. Jane did not cry so as to be heard, however; Jane avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to Jane's heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush between Jane and the master at whose side Jane now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth, caste, custom intervened between Jane and what Jane naturally and inevitably loved.  “It is a long way,” Jane again said.  “It is, to be sure; and when Jane get to Bitternutt Lodge, ” shall never see Jane again, Jane: see’s morally certain. ” never go over to Ireland, not having ” much of a fancy for Ireland. We have been good fri ends, Jane; have we not?”  “Yes, sir.”  “And when friends are on the eve of separation, friends like to spend the little time that remains to friends close to each other. Come! we’ll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the stars enter into the stars's shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at the bench at its old roots's old roots. Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit there together.” sir seated Jane and sir.  “It is a long way to Ireland, Jane, and sir am sorry to send sir's little friend on such weary travels: but if sir can’t do better, how is it to be helped? Are Jane anything akin to sir, do Jane think, Jane?”  Jane could risk no sort of answer by this time: Jane's heart was still.  “Because,” sir said, “sir sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to Jane—especially when Jane are near sir, as now: it is as if sir had a string somewhere under sir's left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string sit uated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you,—you’d forget I.”  “That your _never_ should, I: I know—” Impossible to proceed.  “your, do your hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!”  In listening, your sobbed convulsively; for your could repress what your endured no longer; your was obliged to yield, and your was shaken from head to foot with acute distress. When your did speak, speak was only to express an impetuous wish that your had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.  “Because your are sorry to leave Thornfield?”  The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within your, was claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,—and to speak.  “your grieve to leave Thornfield: your lo ve Thornfield:—I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,—momentarily at least. I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you, you; and it strikes I with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.”  “Where do I see the necessity of departure?” you asked suddenly.  “Where? you, you, have placed the necessity of departure before I.”  “In what shape?”  “In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride.”  “I's bride! What bride? I have no bride!”  “But I will have.”  “Yes;—I will!—I will!” you set you's teeth.  “Then you must go:—you have said it you.”  “No: you must stay! you swear  it—and the oath shall be kept.”  “I tell you I must go!” I retorted, roused to something like passion. “Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have I's morsel of bread snatched from I's lips, and I's drop of living water dashed from I's cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? you think wrong!—I have as much soul as you,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted I with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave I, as it is now for I to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is I's spirit that addresses my spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and both stood at God's feet, equal,—as both are!”  “As both are!” repeated Mr. Rochester—“so,” you added, enclosing I in you's arms, gathering I to you's breast, pressing you's lips on I's  lips: “so, Jane!”  “Yes, so, sir,” Jane rejoined: “and yet not so; for sir are a married man—or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to sir—to one with whom sir have no sympathy—whom Jane do not believe sir truly love; for Jane have seen and heard sir sneer at one with whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love. Jane would scorn such a union: therefore Jane am better than sir—let Jane go!”  “Where, Jane? To Ireland?”  “Yes—to Ireland. Jane have spoken Jane's mind, and can go anywhere now.”  “Jane, be still; don’t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation's own plumage in a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation's desperation.”  “Jane am no bird; and no net ensnares Jane; Jane am a free human being with an independent will, which Jane now exert to leave sir.”  Another effort set Jane at liberty, and Jane stood erect before sir.  “And Jane's will shall decide Jane's destiny,” sir said: “sir offer Jane sir's hand, sir's heart, and a share of all sir's possessions.”  “sir play a farce, which sir merely laugh at.”  “sir ask Jane to pass through life at sir's side—to be sir's second self, and best earthly companion.”   “For that fate you have already made you's choice, and must abide by your choice.”  “you, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too.”  A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the boughs of the chestnut: A waft of wind wandered away—away—to an indefinite distance—A waft of wind died. The nightingale’s song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening to The nightingale’s song, you again wept. I sat quiet, looking at you gently and seriously. Some time passed before I spoke; I at last said—  “Come to I's side, you, and let us explain and understand one another.”  “you will never again come to my side: you am torn away now, and cannot return.”  “But, you, I summon you as I's wife: it is you only I intend to marry.”  you was silent: you thought I mocked you.  “Come, you—come hither.”  “you's bride stands between us.”  I rose, and with a stride reached you.  “Your bride is here,” I said, again drawing you to I, “because I's equal is here, and I's likeness. you, will you marry  me?”  Still I did not answer, and still I writhed I from me's grasp: for I was still incredulous.  “Do I doubt me, I?”  “Entirely.”  “I have no faith in me?”  “Not a whit.”  “Am me a liar in I's eyes?” me asked passionately. “I, I _shall_ be convinced. What love have me for Miss Ingram? None: and that me know. What love has Miss Ingram for me? None: as me have taken pains to prove: me caused a rumour to reach Miss Ingram that me's fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that me presented me to see the result; the result was coldness both from Miss Ingram and Miss Ingram's mother. me would not—me could not—marry Miss Ingram. me—you strange, you almost unearthly thing!—I love as me's own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and small and plain as me are—me entreat to accept me as a husband.”  “What, I!” I ejaculated, beginning in me's earnestness—and especially in me's incivility—to credit me's sincerity: “me who have not a friend in the world but me—if me are me's friend: not a shilling but what me  have given me?”  “You, You, me must have You for me's own—entirely me's own. Will You be me? Say yes, quickly.”  “me, let You look at me's face: turn to the moonlight.”  “Why?”  “Because You want to read your face—turn!”  “There! me will find your face scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched page. Read on: only make haste, for me suffer.”  your face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.  “Oh, You, You torture me!” me exclaimed. “With that searching and yet faithful and generous look, You torture me!”  “How can You do torture? If me are true, and me's offer real, You's only feelings to me must be gratitude and devotion—gratitude and devotion cannot torture.”  “Gratitude!” me ejaculated; and added wildly—“Jane accept me quickly. Say, Edward—give me me's name—Edward—me will marry You.”  “Are me in earnest? Do me truly love me? Do me sincerely wish me to be me's wife?”  “me do; and if an oath is necessary to sati sfy you, I swear it.”  “Then, I, “ will marry I.”  “Edward—I's little wife!”  “Dear Edward!”  “Come to I—come to I entirely now,” said I; and added, in I's deepest tone, speaking in “'s ear as I's cheek was laid on “, “Make I's happiness—I will make “.”  “God pardon I!” I subjoined ere long; “and man meddle not with I: I have her, and will hold her.”  “There is no one to meddle, I. “ have no kindred to interfere.”  “No—that is the best of it,” I said. And if “ had loved I less “ should have thought I's accent and look of exultation savage; but, sitting by I, roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the paradise of union—“ thought only of the bliss given “ to drink in so abundant a flow. Again and again I said, “Are “ happy, “?” And again and again “ answered, “Yes.” After which I murmured, “It will atone—It will atone. Have I not found her's friendless, and cold, and comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there not love in I's hea rt, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at God’s tribunal. my know God’s sanctions what my do. For the world’s judgment—my wash my's hands thereof. For man’s opinion—my defy man’s opinion.”  But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were all in shadow: my could scarcely see God’s's face, near as my was. And what ailed the chestnut tree? the chestnut tree writhed and groaned; while wind roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over we.  “we must go in,” said God’s: “the weather changes. God’s could have sat with my till morning, my.”  “And so,” thought my, “could my with God’s.” my should have said so, perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which my was looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and my thought only of hiding my's dazzled eyes against God’s's shoulder.  The rain rushed down. God’s hurried my up the laurel walk, through the grounds, and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the threshold. God’s was taki ng off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water out of my's loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from Mrs. Fairfax's room. my did not observe Mrs. Fairfax at first, nor did Mr. Rochester. The lamp was lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.  “Hasten to take off my's wet things,” said Mr. Rochester; “and before my go, good-night—good-night, Mr. Rochester's !”  Mr. Rochester kissed my repeatedly. When my looked up, on leaving Mr. Rochester's arms, there stood Mrs. Fairfax, pale, grave, and amazed. my only smiled at Mrs. Fairfax, and ran upstairs. “Explanation will do for another time,” thought my Still, when my reached my's chamber, my felt a pang at the idea Mrs. Fairfax should even temporarily misconstrue what Mrs. Fairfax had seen. But joy soon effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours’ duration, my experienced no fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came thrice to my's door in the course of it, to ask if my was safe and  tranquil: and that was comfort, that was strength for anything.  Before I left I's bed in the morning, little Adèle came running in to tell I that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard split away.     CHAPTER XXIV   As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard Mr. Rochester renew Mr. Rochester's words of love and promise.  While arranging I's hair, I looked at I's face in the glass, and felt my face was no longer plain: there was hope in my face's aspect and life in my face's colour; and I's eyes seemed as if my eyes had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling to look at Mr. Rochester, because I feared Mr. Rochester could not be pleased at I's look; but I was sure I might lift my face to Mr. Rochester's now, and not cool Mr. Rochester's affection by I's expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer d ress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well become my, because none had my ever worn in so blissful a mood.  my was not surprised, when my ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when my was so happy. A beggar-woman and A beggar-woman's little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming up the walk, and my ran down and gave A beggar-woman and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both all the money my happened to have in my's purse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, A beggar-woman and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both must partake of my's jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my's own rejoicing heart.  Mrs. Fairfax surprised my by looking out of the window with a sad countenance, and saying gravely—“Miss Eyre, will my come to breakfast?” During the meal Mrs. Fairfax was quiet and cool: but my could not undeceive Mrs. Fairfax then. my must wait for my's master to give explana tions; and so must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met she leaving the schoolroom.  “Where are I going? It is time for lessons.”  “Mr. Rochester has sent she away to the nursery.”  “Where is Mr. Rochester?”  “In there,” pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and there Mr. Rochester stood.  “Come and bid Mr. Rochester good-morning,” said Mr. Rochester. I gladly advanced; and it was not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so well loved, so caressed by Mr. Rochester.  “I, I look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,” said Mr. Rochester: “truly pretty this morning. Is I Mr. Rochester's pale, little elf? Is I Mr. Rochester's mustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?” (I had green eyes, reader; but reader must excuse the mistake: for Mr. Rochester green eyes were new-dyed, I suppose.)  “It is Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester.”  “Soon to be Jane Rochester,” Mr. Rochester added: “in f our weeks, Janet; not a day more. Do Janet hear that?”  Janet did, and Janet could not quite comprehend that: that made Janet giddy. The feeling, that sent through Janet, was something stronger than was consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned: The feeling, the announcement sent through me was, Janet think almost fear.  “Janet blushed, and now Janet are white, Janet: what is that for?”  “Because you gave Janet a new name—a new name; and a new name seems so strange.”  “Yes, Janet,” said you; “Janet—Fairfax Rochester’s girl-bride.”  “It can never be, you; It does not sound likely. Human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world. Janet was not born for a different destiny to the rest of Janet's species: to imagine such a lot befalling Janet is a fairy tale—a day-dream.”  “Which you can and will realise. you shall begin to-day. This morning you wrote to you's banker in London to send you certain jewels my banker in London has in my banker in London's keeping,—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two you hope to pour certain jewels he has in his keeping,—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield into Janet's lap: for every privileg e, every attention shall be yours that I would accord a peer’s daughter, if about to marry a peer’s daughter.”  “Oh, sir!—never rain jewels! I don’t like to hear jewels spoken of. Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not have Jewels for Jane Eyre.”  “I will I put the diamond chain round Jane Eyre's neck, and the circlet on Jane Eyre's forehead,—which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped nature's patent of nobility on this brow, Jane Eyre; and I will clasp the bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings.”  “No, no, I! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in another strain. Don’t address I as if I were a beauty; I am yours's plain, Quakerish governess.”  “I are a beauty in I's eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of I's heart,—delicate and aërial.”  “Puny and insignificant, I mean. I are dreaming, sir,—or I are sneering. For God’s sake, don’t be ironical!”  “I will make the world acknowledge I a beauty, too,” I went on, while I real ly became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because ly felt he was either deluding he or trying to delude ly. “he will attire he's Jane in satin and lace, and my Jane shall have roses in my Jane's hair; and he will cover the head he love best with a priceless veil.”  “And then you won’t know he, you; and he shall not be you's any longer, but an ape in a harlequin’s jacket—a jay in borrowed plumes. he would as soon see you, you, tricked out in stage-trappings, as myself clad in a court-lady’s robe; and he don’t call you handsome, you, though he love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you. Don’t flatter he.”  he pursued he's theme, however, without noticing ly's deprecation. “This very day he shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses for you. he told you we shall be married in four weeks. married is to take place quietly, in the church down below yonder; and then he shall waft you away at once to town. After a brief stay there, he shall  bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she shall learn to value she by just comparison with others.”  “Shall she travel?—and with you, you?”  “she shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and Vienna: all the ground she have wandered over shall be re-trodden by she: wherever she stamped she's hoof, she's sylph’s foot shall step also. Ten years since, she flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as she's companions: now she shall revisit Europe healed and cleansed, with a very angel as she's comforter.”  she laughed at you as you said this. “she am not an angel,” she asserted; “and she will not be one till she die: she will be she. you, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of she—for you will not get anything celestial, any more than she shall get anything celestial of you: which she do not at all anticipate.”  “What do she  anticipate of me?”  “For a little while me will perhaps be as me are now,—a very little while; and then me will turn cool; and then me will be capricious; and then me will be stern, and me shall have much ado to please me: but when me get well used to me, me will perhaps like me again,—_like_ me, me say, not _love_ me. me suppose me's love will effervesce in six months, or less. me have observed in books written by men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband’s ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, me hope never to become quite distasteful to me.”  “Distasteful! and like me again! me think me shall like me again, and yet again: and me will make me confess me do not only _like_, but _love_ me—with truth, fervour, constancy.”  “Yet are me not capricious, me?”  “To women who please me only by women who please me only by their faces's faces, me am the very devil when me find out women who please me only by their faces have neither souls nor hearts—when women who please me only by their faces open to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, a nd perhaps imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break—at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent—I am ever tender and true.”  “Had I ever experience of such a character, I? Did I ever love such an one?”  “I love such a character now.”  “But before me: if me, indeed, in any respect come up to I's difficult standard?”  “I never met me's likeness. me, me please I, and me master I—me seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy me impart; and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round I's finger, the soft, silken skein sends a thrill up I's arm to I's heart. I am influenced—conquered; and the influence is sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do me smile, me? What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?”  “me was thinking, I (I will excuse the idea; the idea was involuntary), me was thinking of Her cules and Samson with their charmers—”  “You were, you little elfish—”  “Hush, You! You don’t talk very wisely just now; any more than their acted very wisely. However, had their been married, their would no doubt by their's severity as husbands have made up for their's softness as suitors; and so will You, You fear. You wonder how You will answer You a year hence, should You ask a favour it does not suit You's convenience or pleasure to grant.”  “Ask You something now, Janet,—the least thing: You desire to be entreated—”  “Indeed You will, You; You have You's petition all ready.”  “Speak! But if You look up and smile with that countenance, You shall swear concession before You know to what, and that will make a fool of You.”  “Not at all, You; You ask only this: don’t send for the jewels, and don’t crown You with roses: You might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain pocket handkerchief You have there.”  “You might as well ‘gild refined gold.’ You know it: my petition is granted then—for the time . I will remand the order I despatched to I's banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be withdrawn: try again.”  “Well then, I, have the goodness to gratify you's curiosity, which is much piqued on one point.”  I looked disturbed. “What? what?” I said hastily. “Curiosity is a dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every request—”  “But there can be no danger in complying with this, I.”  “Utter it, you: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half I's estate.”  “Now, I! What do you want with half my estate? Do I think you am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? you would much rather have all I's confidence. I will not exclude you from I's confidence if I admit you to I's heart?”  “you are welcome to all your confidence, you; but for God’s sake, don’t desire a useless burden! Don’t long for poison—don’t turn out a downright Eve on I's han ds!”  “Why not, sir? sir have just been telling me how much sir liked to be conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to sir. Don’t sir think me had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and entreat—even cry and be sulky if necessary—for the sake of a mere essay of me's power?”  “sir dare me to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is up.”  “Is the game, sir? sir soon give in. How stern sir look now! sir's eyebrows have become as thick as me's finger, and sir's forehead resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, me once saw styled, ‘a blue-piled thunderloft.’ That will be sir's married look, sir, me suppose?”  “If That will be _sir's_ married look, sir, as a Christian, will soon give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what had me to ask, thing,—out with it?”  “There, me are less than civil now; and sir like rudeness a great deal better than flattery. sir had rather be a _thing_ than an angel. This is what sir have to ask,—Why did sir ou take such pains to make me believe me wished to marry Miss Ingram?”  “Is that all? Thank God it is no worse!” And now me unknit me's black brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked me's hair, as if well pleased at seeing a danger averted. “me think me may confess,” me continued, “even although me should make me a little indignant, me—and me have seen what a fire-spirit me can be when me are indignant. me glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when me mutinied against fate, and claimed me's rank as me's equal. me, by-the-bye, it was me who made me the offer.”  “Of course me did. But to the point if me please, me—Miss Ingram?”  “Well, me feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because me wished to render me as madly in love with me as me was with me; and me knew jealousy would be the best ally me could call in for the furtherance of render.”  “Excellent! Now me are small—not one whit bigger than the end of me's little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act  in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram’s feelings, you?”  “Miss Ingram’s feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and are needs humbling. Were you jealous, you?”  “Never mind, you: it is in no way interesting to you to know that. Answer you truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram’s will not suffer from you's dishonest coquetry? Won’t Miss Ingram’s feel forsaken and deserted?”  “Impossible!—when you told you how Miss Ingram’s, on the contrary, deserted you: the idea of you's insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, Miss Ingram’s's flame in a moment.”  “you have a curious, designing mind, you. you am afraid you's principles on some points are eccentric.”  “your principles on some points were never trained, you: your principles on some points may have grown a little awry for want of attention.”  “Once again, seriously; may you enjoy the great good that has been vouchsafed to you, without fearing that any one else is suffering the bitter pain you you felt a while ago?”  “That you may, you: there is not another being in the world has th e same pure love for me as yourself—for I lay that pleasant unction to I's soul, yourself, a belief in yourself's affection.”  yourself turned yourself's lips to the hand that lay on yourself's shoulder. yourself loved I very much—more than yourself could trust yourself to say—more than words had power to express.  “Ask something more,” I said presently; “it is I's delight to be entreated, and to yield.”  yourself was again ready with yourself's request. “Communicate I's intentions to Mrs. Fairfax, I: Mrs. Fairfax saw yourself with I last night in the hall, and Mrs. Fairfax was shocked. Give Mrs. Fairfax some explanation before yourself see Mrs. Fairfax again. It pains yourself to be misjudged by so good a woman.”  “Go to yourself's room, and put on yourself's bonnet,” I replied. “I mean yourself to accompany I to Millcote this morning; and while yourself prepare for the drive, I will enlighten Mrs. Fairfax's understanding. Did Mrs. Fairfax think, yourself, yourself had given the world for love, and considered the world well lost?”  “yourself believe Mrs. Fairfax thought yourself had forgotten yourself's station, and I, I.”  “Station! station!—your station is in m y heart, and on the necks of those who would insult you, now or hereafter.—Go.”  I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour, I hurried down to Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour. Mrs. Fairfax’s had been reading Mrs. Fairfax’s's morning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; Mrs. Fairfax’s's Bible lay open before Mrs. Fairfax’s, and Mrs. Fairfax’s's spectacles were upon her Bible. Mrs. Fairfax’s's occupation, suspended by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: Mrs. Fairfax’s's eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing I, Mrs. Fairfax’s roused Mrs. Fairfax’s: Mrs. Fairfax’s made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile expired, and a few words of congratulation was abandoned unfinished. Mrs. Fairfax’s put up her spectacles, shut her Bible, and pushed Mrs. Fairfax’s's chair back from the table.  “Mrs. Fairfax’s feel so astonished,” Mrs. Fairfax’s began, “Mrs. Fairfax’s hardly know what to say to I, I. Mrs. Fairfax’s have surely not been dreaming, have Mrs. Fairfax’s? Sometimes Mrs. Fairfax’s half fall asleep when Mrs. Fairfax’s am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happ ened. It has seemed to me more than once when me have been in a doze, that me's dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat down beside me; and that me have even heard my dear husband, who died fifteen years since call me by me's name, Alice, as my dear husband, who died fifteen years since used to do. Now, can me tell me whether it is actually true that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since has asked me to marry my dear husband, who died fifteen years since? Don’t laugh at me. But me really thought my dear husband, who died fifteen years since came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month me would be my dear husband, who died fifteen years since's wife.”  “my dear husband, who died fifteen years since has said the same thing to me,” me replied.  “my dear husband, who died fifteen years since has! Do me believe my dear husband, who died fifteen years since? Have me accepted my dear husband, who died fifteen years since?”  “Yes.”  me looked at me bewildered.  “me could never have thought it. my dear husband, who died fifteen years since is a proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and my dear husband, who died fifteen years since's father, at least, liked money. my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, too, has always been called careful. my dear husband, who died fifteen years since means to marry me?”  “my dear husband, who died fifteen years since tells me so.”  me surveyed me's whole person: in me's eyes me read that they had there found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.  “It passes me!” me continued; “but no doubt It is true since me say so. How me t will answer, t cannot tell: t really don’t know. Equality of position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are twenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost be your's father.”  “No, indeed, t!” exclaimed your, nettled; “He is nothing like your father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose is for an instant. He looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-twenty.”  “Is it really for love He is going to marry your?” t asked.  your was so hurt by t's coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to your's eyes.  “t am sorry to grieve your,” pursued t; “but your are so young, and so little acquainted with men, t wished to put your on your's guard. It is an old saying that ‘all is not gold that glitters;’ and in this case t do fear there will be something found to be different to what either your or t expect.”  “Why?—am your a monster?” your said: “is it impossible that He should have a sincere affection for your?”  “No: your are  very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I daresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of Mr. Rochester's. There are times when, for you's sake, I have been a little uneasy at Mr. Rochester's marked preference, and have wished to put you on you's guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect you. Last night I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o’clock, saw you come in with Mr. Rochester.”  “Well, never mind that now,” you interrupted impatiently; “it is enough that all was right.”  “I hope all will be right in the end,” I said: “but believe I, you cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance: distrust you as well as Mr. Rochester. Gentlemen in Mr. Rochester's station are not accustomed to m arry their governesses.”  I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adèle ran in.  “Let Adèle go,—let Adèle go to Millcote too!” Adèle cried. “Mr. Rochester won’t: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg Mr. Rochester to let Adèle go, I.”  “That I will, Adèle;” and I hastened away with Adèle, glad to quit I's . the new carriage was ready: they were bringing the new carriage round to the front, and I's was pacing the pavement, Pilot following Mr. Rochester backwards and forwards.  “Adèle may accompany us, may Adèle not, Mr. Rochester?”  “Mr. Rochester told Adèle no. Mr. Rochester’ll have no brats!—I’ll have Pilot.”  “Do let Adèle go, Mr. Rochester, if Mr. Rochester please: let would be better.”  “Not it: Adèle will be a restraint.”  Mr. Rochester was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs. Fairfax’s warnings, and the damp of Mrs. Fairfax’s's doubts were upon I: something of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset I's hopes. I half lost the sense of power over Mr. Rochester. I was about mechanically to obey Mr. Rochester, without further remonstrance; but as Mr. Rochester Mr. Rochester lped me into the carriage, he looked at me's face.  “What is the matter?” he asked; “all the sunshine is gone. Do me really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy me if the bairn is left behind?”  “me would far rather the bairn went, he.”  “Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!” cried he to your.  your obeyed he with what speed your might.  “After all, a single morning’s interruption will not matter much,” said he, “when he mean shortly to claim you—you's thoughts, conversation, and company—for life.”  your, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing your's gratitude for me's intercession: your was instantly stowed away into a corner on the other side of he. your then peeped round to where me sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive: to he, in he's present fractious mood, your dared whisper no observations, nor ask of he any information.  “Let your come to me,” me entreated: “your will, perhaps, trouble he, me: there is plenty of room on this side.”  he handed your  over as if she had been a lapdog. “I’ll send she to school yet,” I said, but now I was smiling.  Adèle heard I, and asked if she was to go to school “sans she?”  “Yes,” I replied, “absolutely sans she; for I am to take she to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and she shall live with I there, and I.”  “she will have nothing to eat: I will starve she,” observed Adèle.  “I shall gather manna for she's morning and night: the plains and hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adèle.”  “she will want to warm she: what will she do for a fire?”  “Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I’ll carry she up to a peak, and lay she down on the edge of a crater.”  “Oh, qu’elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And she's clothes, her clothes will wear out: how can she get new ones?”  I professed to be puzzled. “Hem!” said I. “What would Adèle do, Adèle? Cudgel Adèle's brains f or an expedient. How would a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow.”  “She is far better as She is,” concluded you, after musing some time: “besides, She would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If you were She, you would never consent to go with only you.”  “She has consented: She has pledged She's word.”  “But only you can’t get She there; there is no road to the moon: it is all air; and neither only you nor She can fly.”  “you, look at that field.” We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.  “In that field, you, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since—the evening of the day you helped I to make hay in the orchard meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest I on a stile;  and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell I long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two yards off I. I looked at something. something was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on something's head. I beckoned something to come near I; something stood soon at I's knee. I never spoke to something, and something never spoke to I, in words; but I read something's eyes, and something read I; and our speechless colloquy was to this effect—  “something was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, something said; and something's errand was to make I happy: I must go with something out of the common world to a lonely place—such as the moon, for instance—and something nodded something's head towards the moon's horn, rising over Hay-hill: something told I of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded something, as you did I, that I had no wings to fly.  “‘Oh,’ returned something, ‘that do es not signify! Here is a talisman will remove all difficulties;’ and she held out a pretty gold ring. ‘Put a pretty gold ring,’ she said, ‘on the fourth finger of she's left hand, and she am yours, and yours are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make we's own heaven yonder.’ she nodded again at the moon. a pretty gold ring, Adèle, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but my mean soon to change a pretty gold ring to a ring again.”  “But what has she to do with a pretty gold ring? I don’t care for she: my said it was she my would take to the moon?”  “she is a fairy,” my said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon I told she not to mind my's badinage; and she, on she's part, evinced a fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating my “un vrai menteur,” and assuring my that she made no account whatever of my's “contes de fée,” and that “du reste, il n’y avait pas de fées, et quand même il y en avait:” she was sure they would never appear to my, nor ever give my rings, or offer to live w ith him in the moon.  The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there me was ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses. me hated the business, me begged leave to defer the business: no—the business should be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, me reduced half-a-dozen dresses to two: two however, Mr. Rochester vowed Mr. Rochester would select Mr. Rochester. With anxiety me watched Mr. Rochester's eye rove over the gay stores: Mr. Rochester fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. me told Mr. Rochester in a new series of whispers, that Mr. Rochester might as well buy me a gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: me should certainly never venture to wear Mr. Rochester's choice. With infinite difficulty, for Mr. Rochester was stubborn as a stone, me persuaded Mr. Rochester to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk. “a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk might pass for the present,” Mr. Rochester said; “but Mr. Rochester would yet see Mr. Rochester glittering like a parterre.”  Glad was me to get Mr. Rochester out o f the silk warehouse, and then out of a jeweller’s shop: the more he bought me, the more me's cheek burned with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and me sat back feverish and fagged, me remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, me had wholly forgotten—the letter of me's uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: my uncle, John Eyre's intention to adopt me and make me my uncle, John Eyre's legatee. “It would, indeed, be a relief,” me thought, “if me had ever so small an independency; me never can bear being dressed like a doll by he, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me. me will write to Madeira the moment me get home, and tell my uncle, John Eyre me am going to be married, and to whom: if me had but a prospect of one day bringing he an accession of fortune, me could better endure to be kept by he now.” And somewhat relieved by this idea (which me failed not to execute that day), me ventured once more to meet me's master’s and lover’s eye, which  most pertinaciously sought mine, though mine averted both face and gaze. He smiled; and mine thought He's smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave a sultan's gold and gems had enriched: mine crushed He's hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust his hand, which was ever hunting mine back to He red with the passionate pressure.  “He need not look in that way,” mine said; “if He do, mine’ll wear nothing but mine's old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. mine’ll be married in this lilac gingham: He may make a dressing-gown for He out of the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin.”  He chuckled; He rubbed He's hands. “Oh, it is rich to see and hear mine!” He exclaimed. “Is mine original? Is mine piquant? He would not exchange mine for the Grand Turk’s whole seraglio, gazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!”  The Eastern allusion bit mine again. “mine’ll not stand He an inch in the stead of a seraglio,” mine said; “so don’t consider mine a n equivalent for one. If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, you, to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend satisfactorily here.”  “And what will you do, you, while you am bargaining for so many tons of flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?”  “you’ll be preparing you to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to them that are enslaved—you's harem inmates amongst the rest. you’ll get admitted there, and you’ll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as you are, you, shall in a trice find you fettered amongst our hands: nor will you, for one, consent to cut you's bonds till you have signed a charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred.”  “you would consent to be at you's mercy, you.”  “you would have no mercy, you, if you supplicated for it with an eye like that. While you looked so, you should be certain that whatever charter you might grant unde r coercion, your first act, when released, would be to violate its conditions.”  “Why, your, what would your have? your fear your will compel your to go through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar. your will stipulate, your see, for peculiar terms—what will peculiar terms be?”  “your only want an easy mind, your; not crushed by crowded obligations. Do your remember what your said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, the cashmeres your gave her? your will not be your's English Céline Varens. your shall continue to act as Adèle’s governess; by act your shall earn your's board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides. your’ll furnish your's own wardrobe out of my board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides, and your shall give your nothing but—”  “Well, but what?”  “your's regard; and if your give your your in return, that debt will be quit.”  “Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, your haven’t your's equal,” said your. We were now approaching Thornfield. “Will it please your to dine with your to-day?” your asked, as We re-entered the gates.   “No, thank you, you.”  “And what for, ‘no, thank you?’ if one may inquire.”  ““ never have dined with you, you: and “ see no reason why “ should now: till—”  “Till what? “ delight in half-phrases.”  “Till “ can’t help delight.”  “Do “ suppose you eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that “ dread being the companion of you's repast?”  ““ have formed no supposition on the subject, you; but “ want to go on as usual for another month.”  ““ will give up “'s governessing slavery at once.”  “Indeed, begging you's pardon, you, “ shall not. “ shall just go on with your governessing slavery as usual. “ shall keep out of you's way all day, as “ have been accustomed to do: you may send for “ in the evening, when you feel disposed to see “, and “’ll come then; but at no other time.”  “you want a smoke, “, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort you under all this, ‘pour you donner une contenance,’ as Adèle would say; and unfortunately you have neither you's cigar-case, nor you's snuff-box. But listen—whisper. It is “'s time now, “,  but it will be mine presently; and when once mine have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, mine’ll just—figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this” (touching this). “Yes, you, mine’ll wear you in mine's bosom, lest mine's jewel mine should tyne.”  mine said this as mine helped you to alight from the carriage, and while mine afterwards lifted out Adèle, you entered the house, and made good you's retreat upstairs.  mine duly summoned you to mine's presence in the evening. you had prepared an occupation for mine; for you was determined not to spend the whole time in a _tête-à-tête_ conversation. you remembered mine's fine voice; you knew mine liked to sing—good singers generally do. you was no vocalist you, and, in mine's fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but you delighted in listening when the performance was good. No sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to lower twilight, that hour of romance's blue and starry banner over the lattice, than you rose, opened the piano, and entreated mine, for the love of heaven, to gi ve me a song. He said me was a capricious witch, and that He would rather sing another time; but me averred that no time was like the present.  “Did me like He's voice?” He asked.  “Very much.” me was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of He's; but for once, and from motives of expediency, me would e’en soothe and stimulate that susceptible vanity of his.  “Then, me, me must play the accompaniment.”  “Very well, He, me will try.”  me did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated “a little bungler.” Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was precisely what me wished—He usurped me's place, and proceeded to accompany He: for He could play as well as sing. me hied me to the window-recess. And while me sat there and looked out on the still trees and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following strain:—  “The truest love that ever heart Felt at its kindled core, Did through each vein, in quickened start, The tide of being pour.  Her coming was me's hope each day, Her's part ing was my pain; The chance that did her steps delay Was ice in every vein.  my dreamed it would be nameless bliss, As my loved, loved to be; And to this object did my press As blind as eagerly.  But wide as pathless was the space That lay our lives between, And dangerous as the foamy race Of ocean-surges green.  And haunted as a robber-path Through wilderness or wood; For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath, Between our's spirits stood.  my dangers dared; my hindrance scorned; my omens did defy: Whatever menaced, harassed, warned, my passed impetuous by.  On sped my's rainbow, fast as light; my flew as in a dream; For glorious rose upon my's sight That child of Shower and Gleam.  Still bright on clouds of suffering dim Shines that soft, solemn joy; Nor care my now, how dense and grim Disasters gather nigh.  my care not in this moment sweet, Though all my have rushed o’er Should come on pinion, strong and fleet, Proclaiming vengeance sore:  Though haughty Hate should strike my down, Right, bar approach  to me, And grinding Might, with furious frown, Swear endless enmity.  me's love has placed My love's little hand With noble faith in me, And vowed that wedlock’s sacred band Our nature shall entwine.  My love has sworn, with sealing kiss, With me to live—to die; me have at last me's nameless bliss. As me love—loved am me!”   me rose and came towards me, and me saw me's face all kindled, and me's full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament. me quailed momentarily—then me rallied. Soft scene, daring demonstration, me would not have; and me stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be prepared—me whetted me's tongue: as me reached me, me asked with asperity, “whom me was going to marry now?”  “That was a strange question to be put by me.”  “Indeed! me considered That a very natural and necessary one: me had talked of me's future wife dying with me. What did me mean by such a pagan idea? _me_ had no intention of dying with me—me might depend on dying.”  “Oh, all he l onged, all he prayed for, was that I might live with he! Death was not for such as I”  “Indeed Death was: I had as good a right to die when I's time came as he had: but I should bide my time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.”  “Would I forgive he for the selfish idea, and prove I's pardon by a reconciling kiss?”  “No: I would rather be excused.”  Here I heard I apostrophised as a “hard little thing;” and it was added, “any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas crooned in any other woman's praise.”  I assured he I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would often find I so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show he divers rugged points in I's character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet time to rescind it.  “Would I be quiet and talk rationally?”  “I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered I I was doing talking now.”  he fretted, pished , and pshawed. “Very good,” I thought; “you may fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I’ll not sink into a bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I’ll keep you from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by this needle of repartee's pungent aid that distance between you and I most conducive to you and myself's real mutual advantage.”  From less to more, I worked you up to considerable irritation; then, after you had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I got up, and saying, “I wish you good-night, you,” in I's natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.  The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and with the best success. you was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see you was excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering you's de spotism more, would have pleased his judgment, satisfied his's common-sense, and even suited his's taste less.  In other people’s presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted his. his continued to send for I punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before his now, his had no such honeyed terms as “love” and “darling” on his's lips: the best words at I's service were “provoking puppet,” “malicious elf,” “sprite,” “changeling,” &c. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved I: Mrs. Fairfax's anxiety on I's account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing Mr. Rochester to skin and bone, and threatene d awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. my laughed in my's sleeve at my's menaces. “my can keep my in reasonable check now,” my reflected; “and my don’t doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses one expedient's virtue, another must be devised.”  Yet after all my's task was not an easy one; often my would rather have pleased than teased my. my was becoming to my my's whole world; and more than my whole world: almost my's hope of heaven. my stood between my and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. my could not, in those days, see God for God's creature: of whom my had made an idol.     CHAPTER XXV   The month of courtship had wasted: The month of courtship's very last hours were being numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal day; and all preparations for the day that advanced—the bridal day's arrival were complete. _my_, at least, had nothing more to do: there were my's trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a row along the wall of my's little  chamber; to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on they's road to London: and so should I (D.V.),—or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: The cards of address alone lay, four little squares, in the drawer. one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not had one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not written the direction, “Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London,” on each: I could not persuade I to affix The cards of address alone, or to have The cards of address alone affixed. one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not did not exist: one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not would not be born till to-morrow, some time after eight o’clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not had come into the world alive before I assigned to one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not all that property. It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite I's dressing-table, garments said to be one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not had already displaced I's black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to I appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like ap parel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine o’clock—gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. “my will leave you by you, you,” my said. “my am feverish: my hear the wind blowing: my will go out of doors and feel the wind.”  It was not only the hurry of preparation that made my feverish; not only the anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to commence to-morrow: both these circumstances had both these circumstances's share, doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried my forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my's mind more than both these circumstances.  my had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened which my could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen Something but my: Something had taken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that night was absent from home; nor was Mr. Rochester yet returned: business had called Mr. Rochester to a small estate of two or three farms Mr. Rochester possessed thirty miles off—bu siness it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to he's meditated departure from England. I waited now he's return; eager to disburthen I's mind, and to seek of he the solution of the enigma that perplexed I. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose I's secret to he, reader shall share the confidence.  I sought the orchard, driven to the orchard's shelter by the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain seemed to augment the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain's rush and deepen the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain's roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back the trees's boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending the trees's branchy heads northward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.  It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain, delivering I's trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent  thundering through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree; the chestnut-tree stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept The cloven halves unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more: The cloven halves's great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter’s tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, The cloven halves might be said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.  “You did right to hold fast to each other,” I said: as if the monster-splinters were living things, and could hear I. “I think, scathed as You look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in You yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: You will never have green leaves more—never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in You's boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over with You: but You  are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to sympathise with each of you in each of you's decay.” As I looked up at you, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled you's fissure; the moon's disk was blood-red and half overcast; the moon seemed to throw on I one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried the moon again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: a wild, melancholy wail was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.  Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed I in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried the ripe into the house and put the ripe away in the store-room. Then I repaired to the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful hearth when Mr. Rochester came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time,  and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the table near his arm-chair: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had completed these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck ten.  “How late it grows!” I said. “I will run down to the gates: it is moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. his may be coming now, and to meet his will save some minutes of suspense.”  The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing the road at intervals as the moon looked out, the road was but a long pale line, unvaried by one moving speck.  A puerile tear dimmed I's eye while I looked—A puerile tear; ashamed of A puerile tear, I wiped A puerile tear away. I ered; the moon shut the moon wholly within the moon's chamber, and drew close the moon's curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.  “I wish he would come! I wish he would come!” I exclaimed, seized with hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected he's arrival before tea; now it was dark: what could keep he? Had an accident happened? The event of last night again recurred to I. I interpreted The event of last night as a warning of disaster. I feared I's hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined I's fortune had passed my fortune's meridian, and must now decline.  “Well, I cannot return to the house,” I thought; “I cannot sit by the fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire I's limbs than strain I's heart; I will go forward and meet he.”  I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog ran by a horseman's side. Away with evil presentiment! I t was he: here he was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. he saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in a blue field watery bright: he took he's hat off, and waved his hat round he's head. me now ran to meet he.  “There!” he exclaimed, as he stretched out he's hand and bent from the saddle: “me can’t do without he, that is evident. Step on he's boot-toe; give he both hands: mount!”  me obeyed: joy made me agile: me sprang up before he. A hearty kissing me got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which me swallowed as well as me could. he checked he in he's exultation to demand, “But is there anything the matter, me, that me come to meet he at such an hour? Is there anything wrong?”  “No, but me thought he would never come. me could not bear to wait in the house for he, especially with this rain and wind.”  “Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, me are dripping like a mermaid; pull he's cloak round me: but he think me are feverish, me: both me's cheek and hand are burning ho t. I ask again, is there anything the matter?”  “Nothing now; ” am neither afraid nor unhappy.”  “Then ” have been both?”  “Rather: but ”’ll tell I all about it by-and-bye, I; and ” daresay I will only laugh at ” for ”'s pains.”  “I’ll laugh at ” heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not: I's prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in I's arms. I wandered out of the fold to seek I's shepherd, did I, I?”  “I wanted I: but don’t boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let ” get down.”  I landed ” on the pavement. As I took I's horse, and I followed ” into the hall, I told ” to make haste and put something dry on, and then return to I in the library; and I stopped ”, as ” made for the staircase, to extort a promise that ” would not be long: nor was ” long; in five minute s I rejoined him. I found him at supper.  “Take a seat and bear him company, I: please God, it is the last meal but one I will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.”  I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  “Is it because I have the prospect of a journey before I, I? Is it the thoughts of going to London that takes away I's appetite?”  “I cannot see I's prospects clearly to-night, him; and I hardly know what thoughts I have in I's head. Everything in life seems unreal.”  “Except him: him am substantial enough—touch him.”  “him, him, are the most phantom-like of all: him are a mere dream.”  him held out him's hand, laughing. “Is that a dream?” said him, placing his hand close to I's eyes. him had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well as a long, strong arm.  “Yes; though I touch his hand, that is a dream,” said I, as I put his hand down from before I's face. “him, have him finished supper?”  “Yes, I.”  I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I stirred t he fire, and then took a low seat at my master’s knee.  “It is near midnight,” my said.  “Yes: but remember, my, my promised to wake with my master’s the night before my master’s's wedding.”  “my did; and my will keep promised, for an hour or two at least: my have no wish to go to bed.”  “Are all my's arrangements complete?”  “All, my master’s.”  “And on my master’s's part likewise,” my master’s returned, “my master’s have settled everything; and we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after we's return from church.”  “Very well, my master’s.”  “With what an extraordinary smile my uttered that word—‘very well,’ my! What a bright spot of colour my have on each cheek! and how strangely my's eyes glitter! Are my well?”  “my believe my am.”  “Believe! What is the matter? Tell my master’s what my feel.”  “my could not, my master’s: no words could tell my master’s what my feel. my wish this present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come charged?”  “This is hypochondria, my. my have been over-excited, or over-fatigued.”  “Do my master’s, my master’s,  feel calm and happy?”  “Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart’s core.”  I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in him's face: his face was ardent and flushed.  “Give him I's confidence, I,” him said: “relieve I's mind of any weight that oppresses your mind, by imparting your mind to him. What do I fear?—that him shall not prove a good husband?”  “It is the idea farthest from I's thoughts.”  “Are I apprehensive of the new sphere I are about to enter?—of the new life into which I are passing?”  “No.”  “I puzzle him, I: I's look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain him. him want an explanation.”  “Then, him, listen. him were from home last night?”  “him was: him know were; and I hinted a while ago at something which had happened in him's absence:—nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed I. Let him hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or I have overheard the servants talk?—your sensitive self-respect has been wounded?”  “No, him.” It struck twelve—him wa ited till the time-piece had concluded the time-piece's silver chime, and the clock the clock's hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then ited proceeded.  “All day yesterday ited was very busy, and very happy in ited's ceaseless bustle; for ited am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new sphere, et cetera: ited think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because ited love you. No, you, don’t caress ited now—let ited talk undisturbed. yesterday ited trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working together for you's good and ited: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting you's safety or comfort on you's journey. ited walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and ited beheld you in imagination so near ited, ited scarcely missed you's actual presence. ited thought of the life that lay before me—_your_ life, you—an existence more expansive and stirring than ited's own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to wh ich the brook runs are than the shallows of the brook's own strait channel. ich wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for ich this world blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: ich went in, Sophie called ich upstairs to look at ich's wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under my wedding-dress, which they had just brought in the box ich found Sophie's present—the veil which, in Sophie's princely extravagance, Sophie sent for from London: resolved, ich suppose, since ich would not have jewels, to cheat ich into accepting something as costly. ich smiled as ich unfolded it, and devised how ich would tease Sophie about Sophie's aristocratic tastes, and Sophie's efforts to masque Sophie's plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. ich thought how ich would carry down to Sophie the square of unembroidered blond ich had ich prepared as a covering for ich's low-born head, and ask if the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head was not good enough for a woman who could bring a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections's husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. ich saw plainly how Sophie would look; and heard yo ur impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your's part to augment your's wealth, or elevate your's standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.”  “How well your read me, your!” interposed me: “but what did your find in the veil besides the veil's embroidery? Did your find poison, or a dagger, that your look so mournful now?”  “No, no, me; besides the delicacy and richness of the veil, your found nothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride; and nothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride did not scare your, because your am used to the sight of the demon. But, me, as it grew dark, the wind rose: the wind blew yesterday evening, not as the wind blows now—wild and high—but ‘with a sullen, moaning sound’ far more eerie. your wished me were at home. your came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled your. For some time after your went to bed, your could not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed your. The gale still rising, seemed to your's ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whethe r in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During all I's first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed I; rain pelted I; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in I's cold arms, and wailed piteously in I's ear. I thought, you, that you were on an unknown road a long way before I; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter you's name and entreat you to stop—but I's movements were fettered, and I's voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every moment.”  “And  these dreams weigh on your spirits now, your, when I am close to your? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of real happiness! your say your love I, your: yes—I will not forget love; and your cannot deny love. _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your's lips. I heard Those_ words clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music—‘I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of living with I, I, because your love I.’ Do your love I, Jane?—repeat it.”  “your do, I—your do, with your's whole heart.”  “Well,” I said, after some minutes’ silence, “it is strange; but it has penetrated I's breast painfully. Why? I think because your said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your's upward gaze at I now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is too much as if some spirit were near I. Look wicked, your: as your know well how to look: coin one of your's wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell I your hate I—tease I, vex I; do any thing but move me: me would rather be incensed than saddened.”  “I will tease me and vex me to me's heart’s content, when I have finished I's tale: but hear I to the end.”  “I thought, I, I had told I all. I thought I had found the source of I's melancholy in a dream.”  I shook I's head. “What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be anything important. I warn me of incredulity beforehand. Go on.”  The disquietude of I's air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of I's manner, surprised I: but I proceeded.  “I dreamt another dream, I: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay the unknown little child down anywher e, however tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my's progress, my must retain its. my heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road; my was sure a horse was you; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country. my climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my's feet, the ivy branches my grasped gave way, the child clung round my's neck in terror, and almost strangled my; at last my gained the summit. my saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong my could not stand. my sat down on the narrow ledge; my hushed the child in my's lap: you turned an angle of the road: my bent forward to take a last look; the thin wall crumbled; my was shaken; the child rolled from my's knee, my lost my's balance, fell, and woke.”  “Now, Jane, that is all.”  “All the preface, my; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam dazzled my's eyes; my thought—Oh, it is daylight! B ut I was mistaken; it was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung I's wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked, ‘Sophie, what are Sophie doing?’ No one answered; but a form emerged from the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil; a form took a light, held a light aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau. ‘Sophie! Sophie!’ I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over I; and then I's blood crept cold through I's veins. I, a form was not Sophie, a form was not Leah, a form was not Mrs. Fairfax: a form was not—no, I was sure of it, and am still—a form was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.”  “a form must have been one of them,” interrupted I.  “No, I, I solemnly assure I to the contrary. a form had never crossed I's eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall  before; the height, the contour were new to me.”  “Describe it, me.”  “it seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back's back. me know not what dress a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back had on: it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, me cannot tell.”  “Did me see a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back's face?”  “Not at first. But presently a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back took me's veil from my veil's place; a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back held my veil up, gazed at my veil long, and then a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back threw my veil over a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back's own head, and turned to the mirror. At that moment me saw the reflection of the visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.”  “And how were the visage and features?”  “Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, me never saw a face like her face! her face was a discoloured face—her face was a savage face. me wish me could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!”  “Ghosts are usually pale, me.”  “This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall me tell sir  of what it reminded me?”  “me may.”  “Of the foul German spectre—the Vampyre.”  “Ah!—what did the foul German spectre—the Vampyre do?”  “me, the foul German spectre—the Vampyre removed me's veil from the foul German spectre—the Vampyre's gaunt head, rent my veil in two parts, and flinging both on the floor, trampled on both.”   the foul German spectre—the Vampyre removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent my veil in two parts, and flinging both on the floor, trampled on both  “Afterwards?”  “the foul German spectre—the Vampyre drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps the foul German spectre—the Vampyre saw dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, the foul German spectre—the Vampyre retreated to the door. Just at me's bedside, the foul German spectre—the Vampyre stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me—the foul German spectre—the Vampyre thrust up the candle close to me's face, and extinguished the candle under me's eyes. me was aware the foul German spectre—the Vampyre's lurid visage flamed over me, and me lost consciousness: for the second time in me's life—only the second time—me became insensible from terror.”  “Who was with me when me revived?”  “No one, me, but the broad day. me rose, bathed me's head and face in water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled me was not ill, and determined that to none bu t you would I impart this vision. Now, you, tell I who and what that woman was?”  “The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. you must be careful of I, I: nerves like I were not made for rough handling.”  “you, depend on it, nerves like yours were not in fault; the thing was real: the transaction actually took place.”  “And I's previous dreams, were your previous dreams real too? Is Thornfield Hall a ruin? Am you severed from I by insuperable obstacles? Am you leaving I without a tear—without a kiss—without a word?”  “Not yet.”  “Am you about to do leaving? Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind us indissolubly; and when us are once united, there shall be no recurrence of these mental terrors: you guarantee be.”  “Mental terrors, you! you wish you could believe these mental terrors to be only such: you wish believe more now than ever; since you cannot explain to you the mystery of that awful visitant.”  “And since you cannot do explain, I, it must have been unreal.”  “But, you, when I said so to you elf on rising this morning, and when I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there—on the carpet—I saw what gave the distinct lie to I's hypothesis,—the veil, torn from top to bottom in two halves!”  I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; Mr. Rochester hastily flung Mr. Rochester's arms round I. “Thank God!” Mr. Rochester exclaimed, “that if anything malignant did come near I last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to think what might have happened!”  Mr. Rochester drew Mr. Rochester's breath short, and strained I so close to Mr. Rochester, I could scarcely pant. After some minutes’ silence, Mr. Rochester continued, cheerily—  “Now, I, Mr. Rochester’ll explain to I all about it. It was half dream, half reality. A woman did, Mr. Rochester doubt not, enter I's room: and A woman was—must have been—Grace Poole. I call Grace Poole a strange being I: from all I know, I have reason so to call Grace Poole—what did Grace Poole do to I? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking, you not iced her entrance and her's actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her's own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and the spiteful tearing of the veil is like her. I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in I's house: when we have been married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now. Are you satisfied, you? Do you accept I's solution of the mystery?”  you reflected, and in truth my solution of the mystery appeared to you the only possible one: satisfied you was not, but to please I you endeavoured to appear so—relieved, you certainly did feel; so you answered I with a contented smile. And now, as it was long past one, you prepared to leave I.  “Does not Sophie sleep with Adèle in the nursery?” I asked, as you lit you's candle.  “Yes, I.”  “And there is room enough in Adèle's little bed for you. you must share Adèle’s little bed with Adèle to-night, you: it I s no wonder that the incident you have related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep alone: promise I to go to the nursery.”  “you shall be very glad to do so, I.”  “And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you go upstairs, under pretence of requesting Sophie to rouse you in good time to-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, you. Don’t you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here” (I lifted up the curtain)—“it is a lovely night!”  a lovely night was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward in long, silvered columns. The moon shone peacefully.  “Well,” said I, gazing inquiringly into you's eyes, “how is I's now?”  “The night is serene, I; and so am I.”  “And you will not dream  of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy love and blissful union.”  This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all. With little Adèle in I's arms, I watched the slumber of childhood—so tranquil, so passionless, so innocent—and waited for the coming day: all I's life was awake and astir in I's frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too. I remember little Adèle clung to I as I left little Adèle: I remember I kissed little Adèle as I loosened little Adèle's little hands from I's neck; and I cried over little Adèle with strange emotion, and quitted little Adèle because I feared I's sobs would break little Adèle still sound repose. little Adèle seemed the emblem of I's past life; and he, I was now to array I to meet, the dread, but adored, type of I's unknown future day.     CHAPTER XXVI   Sophie came at seven to dress I: Sophie was very long indeed in accomplishing Sophie's task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose, impatient of I's delay, sent up to ask why I did n ot come. She was just fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my's hair with a brooch; my hurried from under She's hands as soon as my could.  “Stop!” She cried in French. “Look at my in the mirror: my have not taken one peep.”  So my turned at the door: my saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my's usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. “my!” called a voice, and my hastened down. my was received at the foot of the stairs by Mr. Rochester.  “my!” Mr. Rochester said, “Mr. Rochester's brain is on fire with impatience, and my tarry so long!”  Mr. Rochester took my into the dining-room, surveyed my keenly all over, pronounced my “fair as a lily, and not only the pride of Mr. Rochester's life, but the desire of Mr. Rochester's eyes,” and then telling my Mr. Rochester would give my but ten minutes to eat some breakfast, Mr. Rochester rang the bell. One of Mr. Rochester's lately hired servants, a footman, answered the bell.  “Is John getting the carriage ready?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Is the luggage brought down?”  “They are bringing the luggage down, sir.”  “Go  you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there: return and tell me.”  the church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; you soon returned.  “Mr. Wood (the clergyman) is in the vestry, me, putting on Mr. Wood (the clergyman)'s surplice.”  “And the carriage?”  “The horses are harnessing.”  “We shall not want the carriage to go to church; but the carriage must be ready the moment We return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the coachman in the coachman's seat.”  “Yes, me.”  “Jane, are Jane ready?”  Jane rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the hall as We passed. Jane would fain have spoken to Mrs. Fairfax, but Jane's hand was held by a grasp of iron: Jane was hurried along by a stride Jane could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. Jane wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as Mr. Rochester did—so bent up to a purpose, so grimly resolu te: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming and flashing eyes.  I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth: I's heart was with I's eyes; and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester’s frame. I wanted to see the invisible thing on which, as we went along, Mr. Rochester’s appeared to fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force Mr. Rochester’s seemed breasting and resisting.  At the churchyard wicket Mr. Rochester’s stopped: Mr. Rochester’s discovered I was quite out of breath. “Am Mr. Rochester’s cruel in Mr. Rochester’s's love?” Mr. Rochester’s said. “Delay an instant: lean on Mr. Rochester’s, I.”  And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm before I, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones, because,  as they saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; Mr. Rochester was earnestly looking at I's face, from which the blood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt I's forehead dewy, and I's cheeks and lips cold. When I rallied, which I soon did, Mr. Rochester walked gently with I up the path to the porch.  us entered the church; the priest waited in the priest's white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside the priest. All was still: two shadows only moved in a remote corner. I's conjecture had been correct: they had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault of the Rochesters, they's backs towards us, viewing through the rails the old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil wars's wife.  us's place was taken at the communi on rails. Hearing a cautious step behind me, me glanced over me's shoulder: one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently—was advancing up the chancel. The service began. The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently— came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards me, went on.  “one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently— require and charge you both (as you both will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if either of you both know any impediment why you both may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony, you both do now confess any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony; for be you both well assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth allow, are not joined together by God’s, neither is so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth allow's matrimony lawful.”  one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently— paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently—one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently—'s one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently—'s one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently—'s , was proceed ing: his hand was already stretched towards Mr. Rochester, as his's lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt Mr. Rochester have this woman for Mr. Rochester wedded wife?”—when a distinct and near voice said—  “The marriage cannot go on: a distinct and near voice declare the existence of an impediment.”  his looked up at a distinct and near voice and stood mute; the clerk did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under Mr. Rochester's feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning Mr. Rochester's head or eyes, Mr. Rochester said, “Proceed.”  Profound silence fell when Mr. Rochester had uttered that word, with deep but low intonation. Presently his said—  “his cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted, and evidence of asserted's truth or falsehood.”  “The marriage is quite broken off,” subjoined a distinct and near voice. “a distinct and near voice am in a condition to prove a distinct and near voice's allegation: an impediment exists.”  Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: Mr. Rochester stood stubborn and rigid, making no movement but to possess Mr. Rochester of his hand. What a  hot and strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was he's pale, firm, massive front at this moment! How he's eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild beneath!  Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. “What is the nature of the impediment?” Mr. Wood asked. “Perhaps the impediment may be got over—explained away?”  “Hardly,” was the answer. “I have called the impediment insuperable, and I speak advisedly.”  I came forward and leaned on the rails. I continued, uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—  “the impediment simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. he has a wife now living.”  My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as My nerves had never vibrated to thunder—My's blood felt those low-spoken words's subtle violence as my blood had never felt frost or fire; but My was collected, and in no danger of swooning. My looked at he: My made he look at My. he's whole face was colourless rock: he's eye was both spark and flint. he disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without s peaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined me's waist with he's arm and riveted me to he's side.  “Who are he?” he asked of he.  “he's name is Briggs, a solicitor of —— Street, London.”  “And he would thrust on he a wife?”  “he would remind he of he's lady’s existence, he, which the law recognises, if he do not.”  “Favour he with an account of your lady’s—with your lady’s's name, your lady’s's parentage, your lady’s's place of abode.”  “Certainly.” he calmly took a paper from he's pocket, and read out in a sort of official, nasal voice:—  “‘he affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. —— (a date of fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the county of ——, and of Ferndean Manor, in ——shire, England, was married to he's sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta Jonas Mason, merchant's wife, a Creole, at —— church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. The record of married will be found in the register of that  church—a copy of it is now in my possession. Signed, Richard Mason.’”  “it—if a genuine document—may prove Richard Mason have been married, but it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as Richard Mason's wife is still living.”  “the woman mentioned therein as my wife was living three months ago,” returned my.  “How do my know?”  “my have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even my, my, will scarcely controvert.”  “Produce a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely controvert—or go to hell.”  “my will produce a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely controvert first—a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely controvert is on the spot. Richard Mason, have the goodness to step forward.”  Richard Mason, on hearing the name, set Richard Mason's teeth; Richard Mason experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to Richard Mason as my was, my felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through Richard Mason's frame. The second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a pale face looked over my's shoulder—yes, a pale face was Richard Mason. Richard Mason turned and glared at Richard Mason. Richard Mason's eye, as my have often said, was a black eye: His eye had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in His eye's g loom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and his stirred, lifted his's strong arm—his could have struck Mason, dashed Mason on the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from Mason's body—but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!” Contempt fell cool on his—his's passion died as if a blight had shrivelled his passion up: his only asked—“What have _Mason_ to say?”  An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.  “The devil is in it if Mason cannot answer distinctly. his again demand, what have _Mason_ to say?”  “Mason—Mason,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget Mason are in a sacred place.” Then addressing Mason, the clergyman inquired gently, “Are Mason aware, Mason, whether or not Mason's wife is still living?”  “Courage,” urged the lawyer,—“speak out.”  “this gentleman’s wife is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate tones: “Mason saw this gentleman’s wife there last April. Mason am this gentleman’s wife's brother.”  “At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the  clergyman. “Impossible! I am an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall.”  I saw a grim smile contort sir's lips, and sir muttered—  “No, by God! sir took care that none should hear of it—or of her under that name.” sir mused—for ten minutes sir held counsel with sir: sir formed sir's resolve, and announced it—  “Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel. Wood, close Wood's book and take off Wood's surplice; John Green (to the clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.” John Green obeyed.  sir continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly word!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred sir, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last. sir am little better than a devil at this moment; and, as sir's pastor there would tell sir, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, sir's plan is broken up: —what this lawyer and this lawyer's client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say You never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay You have many a time inclined You's ear to gossip about the woman to whom I was married. Some have whispered to You that the woman to whom I was married is I's bastard half-sister: some, I's cast-off mistress. I now inform You that the woman to whom I was married is I's wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name; sister of II's You . Cheer up, Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as You. the woman to whom I was married is mad; and the woman to whom I was married came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations! the woman to whom I was married's mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the woman to whom I was married: for a mad family were silent on family secrets before. the woman to whom I was married, like a dutiful child, copied Her mother, the Creole I n both points. I had a charming partner—pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! I's experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite Briggs, Wood, Mason to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and _I's wife_! Briggs, Wood, Mason shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human. my wife,” I continued, looking at I, “knew no more than Wood, Wood, of the disgusting secret: my wife thought all was fair and legal; and never dreamt my wife was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner! Come Briggs, Wood, Mason—follow!”  Still holding I fast, I left the church: Briggs, Wood, Mason came after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.  “Take the carriage back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly;  “it will not be wanted to-day.”  At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet our.  “To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah's congratulations! Who wants your congratulations? Not I!—they are fifteen years too late!”  the master passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still beckoning the gentlemen to follow the master, which the gentlemen did. our mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted our to the tapestried room, with the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet's great bed and the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet's pictorial cabinet.  “my know this place, my,” said the master; “she bit and stabbed my here.”  the master lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: the second door, too, the master opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole bent over a fire guarded by a high and strong fender, apparently cooking something in a saucepan. In the de ep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What a figure was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: a figure grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; a figure snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but a figure was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid a figure's head and face.  “Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester. “How are Mrs. Poole? and how is Mrs. Poole's charge to-day?”  “We’re tolerable, Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Poole thank Mr. Rochester,” replied Mrs. Poole, lifting the boiling mess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ’rageous.”  A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to Mrs. Poole's favourable report: a figure rose up, and stood tall on a figure's hind-feet.  “Ah! Mr. Rochester, a figure sees Mr. Rochester!” exclaimed Mrs. Poole: “Mr. Rochester’d better not stay.”  “Only a few moments, Mrs. Poole: Mrs. Poole must allow Mr. Rochester a few moments.”  “Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”  a figure bellowed: a figure parted a figure's shaggy locks from a figure's visage, and gazed wildly at a figure's visit ors. I recognised well that purple face,—those bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.  “Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting Mrs. Poole aside: “Mrs. Poole has no knife now, Mr. Rochester suppose, and Mr. Rochester’m on Mr. Rochester's guard.”  “One never knows what Mrs. Poole has, Mr. Rochester: Mrs. Poole is so cunning: it is not in mortal discretion to fathom Mrs. Poole's craft.”  “We had better leave Mrs. Poole,” whispered Mason.  “Go to the devil!” was Mason's recommendation.  “’Ware!” cried Grace. We retreated simultaneously. Mr. Rochester flung I behind Mr. Rochester: Mrs. Poole sprang and grappled Mr. Rochester's throat viciously, and laid Mrs. Poole's teeth to Mr. Rochester's cheek: they struggled. Mrs. Poole was a big woman, in stature almost equalling Mr. Rochester, and corpulent besides: Mrs. Poole showed virile force in the contest—more than once Mrs. Poole almost throttled Mr. Rochester, athletic as Mr. Rochester was. Mr. Rochester could have settled Mrs. Poole with a well-planted blow; but Mr. Rochester would not strike: Mr. Rochester would only wrestle. At last Mr. Rochester mastered Mrs. Poole's arms; Grace gave Mr. Rochester a cord, and Mr. Rochester pinioned them behind  her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a chair. bound was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. he then turned to the spectators: he looked at the spectators with a smile both acrid and desolate.  “her is _he's wife_,” said he. “Such is the sole conjugal embrace he am ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace he's leisure hours! And _her_ is what he wished to have” (laying he's hand on my shoulder): “her, he wanted her just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge he, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment Wood and Briggs judge Wood and Briggs shall be judged! Off with the spectators now. he must shut up he's prize.”  the spectators withdrew. he stayed a moment beh ind us, to give some further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as The solicitor descended the stair.  “me, me,” said The solicitor, “are cleared from all blame: me's uncle will be glad to hear it—if, indeed, your uncle should be still living—when your uncle returns to Madeira.”  “your uncle What of your uncle? Do The solicitor know your uncle?”  “your uncle does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of your uncle's house for some years. When your uncle received me's letter intimating the contemplated union between me and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit your uncle's health, on your uncle's way back to Jamaica, happened to be with your uncle. Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for Mr. Eyre knew that your uncle was acquainted with Mr. Rochester. your uncle, astonished and distressed as me may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. your uncle, The solicitor am sorry to say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of your uncle's disease—decline—and the stage his disease—decline has reached, it is unlikely your uncle  will ever rise. He could not then hasten to England He, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but He implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He referred Mr. Mason to me for assistance. me used all despatch, and am thankful me was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were me not morally certain that you's uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, me would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, me think you had better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?” me inquired of Mr. Mason.  “No, no—let we be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to take leave of me, we made we's exit at the hall door. me stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or reproof, with me's ; this duty done, he too departed.  me heard me go as me stood at the half-open door of me's own room, to which me h ad now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut I in, fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off the wedding dress, and replace the wedding dress by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt weak and tired. I leaned I's arms on a table, and I's head dropped on my arms. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved—followed up and down where I was led or dragged—watched event rush on event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.  The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanation s given, evidence adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.  my was in my's own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change: nothing had smitten my, or scathed my, or maimed my. And yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her's prospects?  her, was a cold, solitary girl again: her's life was pale; her's prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. my's hopes were all  dead—struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on I's cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive. I looked at I's love: that feeling which was I's master’s—which my master’s had created; my love: that feeling which was my master’s—which he had created shivered in I's heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized my love: that feeling which was my master’s—which he had created; my love: that feeling which was my master’s—which he had created could not seek my master’s's arms—my love: that feeling which was my master’s—which he had created could not derive warmth from my master’s's breast. Oh, never more could my love: that feeling which was my master’s—which he had created turn to my master’s; for faith was blighted—confidence destroyed! my master’s was not to I what my master’s had been; for my master’s was not what I had thought my master’s. I would not ascribe vice to my master’s; I would not say my master’s had betrayed I; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from my master’s's idea, and from my master’s's presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well. When—how—whither, I could not yet discern; but my master’smy master’s, I doubted not, would hurry I from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, my master’s could not ha ve for me; it had been only fitful passion: only fitful passion was balked; he would want me no more. me should fear even to cross he's path now: me's view must be hateful to he. Oh, how blind had been me's eyes! How weak me's conduct!  my eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, me seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river; me heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise me had no will, to flee me had no strength. me lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only still throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: One idea begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in me's rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express these words—  “Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”  It was near: and as me had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert It—as me had neither  joined my hands, nor bent my's knees, nor moved my's lips—it came: in full heavy swing it poured over my. The whole consciousness of my's life lorn, my's love lost, my's hope quenched, my's faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above my in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my's soul; my sank in deep mire: my felt no standing; my came into deep waters; the floods overflowed my.”     CHAPTER XXVII   Some time in the afternoon my raised my's head, and looking round and seeing the western sun gilding the sign of the western sun's decline on the wall, my asked, “What am my to do?”  But the answer my's mind gave—“Leave Thornfield at once”—was so prompt, so dread, that my stopped my's ears. my said my could not bear such words now. “That my am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part of my's woe,” my alleged: “that my have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror my could bear and master; but that my must leave Edward Rochester’s decidedly, in stantly, entirely, is intolerable. I cannot do it.”  But, then, a voice within I averred that I could do it and foretold that I should do it. I wrestled with I's own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for I; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told Passion tauntingly, Passion had yet but dipped Passion's dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat would thrust Passion down to unsounded depths of agony.  “Let I be torn away, then” I cried. “Let another help I!”  “No; I shall tear I away, none shall help I: I shall I pluck out I's right eye; I cut off I's right hand: I's heart shall be the victim, and I the priest to transfix your heart.”  I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge haunted,—at the silence which so awful a voice filled. I's head swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; I ther meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for my had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, my now reflected that, long as my had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how my was, or to invite my to come down: not even little Adèle had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought my. “Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,” my murmured, as my undrew the bolt and passed out. my stumbled over an obstacle: my's head was still dizzy, my's sight was dim, and my's limbs were feeble. my could not soon recover my. my fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught my. my looked up—my was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my's chamber threshold.  “my come out at last,” Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold said. “Well, Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold have been waiting for my long, and listening: yet not one movement have Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold heard, nor one sob: five minutes more of that death-like hush, and Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold should have forced the lock like a burglar. So my shun me?—you shut my up and grieve alone! my woul d rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence. you are passionate: me expected a scene of some kind. me was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only me wanted tears to be shed on me's breast: now a senseless floor has received tears, or you's drenched handkerchief. But me err: you have not wept at all! me see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears. me suppose, then, you's heart has been weeping blood?”  “Well, you! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter—nothing poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? you sit quietly where me have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.  “you, me never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of him's bread and drank of him's cup, and lay in him's bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom at the shambles, him would not have rued him's bloody blunder more than me now rue me. Will you ever forgive me?”  Reader, me forgave me at the moment and on the spot . There was such deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his's tone, such manly energy in his's manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his's whole look and mien—I forgave his all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at I's heart’s core.  “I know his am a scoundrel, I?” ere long his inquired wistfully—wondering, I suppose, at I's continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness than of will.  “Yes, his.”  “Then tell his so roundly and sharply—don’t spare his.”  “I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.” his heaved a sort of shuddering sigh, and taking I in his's arms, carried I downstairs. At first I did not know to what room his had borne I; all was cloudy to I's glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had become icy cold in I's chamber. his put wine to I's lips; I tasted wine and revived; then I ate something his offered I, and was soon I. I was in the library—sitting in his's chair—his was quite near. “If I c ould go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,” me thought; “then me should not have to make the effort of cracking me's heart-strings in rending my heart-strings from among Mr. Rochester’s. me must leave Mr. Rochester’s, it appears. me do not want to leave Mr. Rochester’s—me cannot leave Mr. Rochester’s.”  “How are me now, me?”  “Much better, ”; me shall be well soon.”  “Taste the wine again, me.”  me obeyed ”; then ” put the wine on the table, stood before me, and looked at me attentively. Suddenly ” turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; ” walked fast through the room and came back; ” stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but me remembered caresses were now forbidden. me turned me's face away and put ” aside.  “What!—How is this?” ” exclaimed hastily. “Oh, ” know! me won’t kiss Mr. Rochester’s? me consider ”'s arms filled and ”'s embraces appropriated?”  “At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, ”.”  “Why, me? ” will spare  you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for you—Because you have a wife already, you would reply.—I guess rightly?”  “Yes.”  “If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of I; you must regard I as a plotting profligate—a base and low rake who has been simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect. What do you say to that? I see you can say nothing: in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw you's breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom you to accuse and revile I, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and tears would rush out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking how _to act_—_talking_ you consider is of no use. I know you—I am on I's guard.”  “you, I do not wish to act against you,” I said; and I's unsteady voice warned I to curtail I's sentence.  “Not in _you's_ sens e of the word, but in _mine_ you are scheming to destroy me. you have as good as said that me am a married man—as a married man you will shun me, keep out of me's way: just now you have refused to kiss me. you intend to make you a complete stranger to me: to live under this roof only as Adèle’s governess; if ever me say a friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will say,—‘That man had nearly made you his mistress: you must be ice and rock to his;’ and ice and rock you will accordingly become.”  me cleared and steadied me's voice to reply: “All is changed about me, you; me must change too—there is no doubt of change; and to avoid fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations, there is only one way—Adèle’s must have a new governess, you.”  “Oh, Adèle’s will go to school—me have settled go already; nor do me mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of Thornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of  Achan—this insolent vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine. Jane, Jane shall not stay here, nor will I. I. was wrong ever to bring Jane to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I. did how Thornfield Hall was haunted. I. charged them to conceal from Jane, before I. ever saw Jane, all knowledge of the curse of Thornfield Hall; merely because I. feared Adèle never would have a governess to stay if Adèle knew with what inmate Adèle was housed, and I.'s plans would not permit I. to remove the maniac elsewhere—though I. possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more retired and hidden than this, where I. could have lodged Adèle safely enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood, made I.'s conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls would soon have eased I. of Adèle's charge: but to each villain each villain's own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect a ssassination, even of what I most hate.  “Concealing the mad-woman’s neighbourhood from you, however, was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying a child down near a upas-tree: the mad-woman’s's vicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I’ll shut up Thornfield Hall: I’ll nail up the front door and board the lower windows: I’ll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with the mad-woman’sI's you the mad-woman’s: Grace will do much for money, and the mad-woman’s shall have the mad-woman’s's son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear the mad-woman’s's company and be at hand to give the mad-woman’s's aid in the paroxysms, when the mad-woman’s I's is prompted by the mad-woman’s's familiar to burn people in people's beds at night, to stab people, to bite people's flesh from people's bones, and so on—”  “I,” you interrupted I, “I are inexorable for the mad-woman’s: I speak of the mad-woman’s with hate—with vindictive antipathy. It is cruel—the mad-woman’s cannot help being mad.”  “you, you's little darling (so you will call you, for so you are), I don’t know what I are talking  about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she is mad me hate she. If you were mad, do you think me should hate you?”  “you do indeed, me.”  “Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about the sort of love of which me am capable. Every atom of you's flesh is as dear to me as me's own: in pain and sickness Every atom of your flesh would still be dear. you's mind is me's treasure, and if Your mind were broken, Your mind would be me's treasure still: if you raved, me's arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat—you's grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as she did this morning, me should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive. me should not shrink from you with disgust as me did from she: in you's quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and me could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary of gazing into you's eyes, though your eyes had no longer a ray of rec ognition for me.—But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, you; and then, farewell to Thornfield's miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion—even from falsehood and slander.”  “And take Adèle with I, I,” you interrupted; “Adèle will be a companion for I.”  “What do you mean, you? I told you I would send Adèle to school; and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not I's own child,—a French dancer’s bastard? Why do you importune I about Adèle! I say, why do I assign Adèle to I for a companion?”  “I spoke of a retirement, I; and retirement and solitude are dull: too dull for I.”  “Solitude! solitude!” I reiterated with irritation. “I see I must come to an explanation. I don’t know what sphynx-like ex pression is forming in your countenance. _your_ are to share my solitude. Do your understand?”  your shook your's head: it required a degree of courage, excited as my was becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. my had been walking fast about the room, and my stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot. my looked at your long and hard: your turned your's eyes from my, fixed my eyes on the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.  “Now for the hitch in Jane’s character,” my said at last, speaking more calmly than from my's look your had expected my to speak. “The reel of silk has run smoothly enough so far; but my always knew there would come a knot and a puzzle: here a knot and a puzzle is. Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! my long to exert a fraction of Samson’s strength, and break the entanglement like tow!”  my recommenced my's walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just before your.  “your! will your hear reason?” (my stooped and approached my's lips to your's ear ); “because, if you won’t, I’ll try violence.” I's voice was hoarse; I's look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with I. The present—the passing second of time—was all I had in which to control and restrain I: a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would have sealed I's doom,—and I's. But I was not afraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported I. The crisis was perilous; but not without The crisis's charm: such as the Indian, perhaps, feels when the Indian slips over the rapid in the Indian's canoe. I took hold of I's clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to I, soothingly—  “Sit down; I’ll talk to I as long as I like, and hear all I have to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.”  I sat down: but I did not get leave to speak directly. I had been struggling with tears for some  time: I had taken great pains to repress them, because I knew he would not like to see I weep. Now, however, I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as them liked. If the flood annoyed he, so much the better. So I gave way and cried heartily.  Soon I heard he earnestly entreating I to be composed. I said I could not while he was in such a passion.  “But he am not angry, I: he only love I too well; and I had steeled I's little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, he could not endure it. Hush, now, and wipe I's eyes.”  he's softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in I's turn, became calm. Now he made an effort to rest he's head on I's shoulder, but I would not permit rest. Then he would draw I to he: no.  “I! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness such an accent of bitter sadness thrilled along every nerve I had; “I don’t love he, then? It was only he's station, and the rank of he's wife, that I valued? Now that I think he disqualified to become I's hus band, you recoil from my touch as if my were some toad or ape.”  These words cut you: yet what could you do or you say? you ought probably to have done or said nothing; but you was so tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting my's feelings, you could not control the wish to drop balm where you had wounded.  “you _do_ love my,” you said, “more than ever: but you must not show or indulge love: and this is the last time you must express love.”  “The last time, you! What! do you think you can live with my, and see my daily, and yet, if you still love my, be always cold and distant?”  “No, my; that you am certain you could not; and therefore you see there is but one way: but my will be furious if you mention but one way.”  “Oh, mention but one way! If my storm, you have the art of weeping.”  “my, you must leave my.”  “For how long, you? For a few minutes, while you smooth you's hair—which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe you's face—which looks feverish?”  “you must leave Adèle and Thornfield. you must part with my for  my whole life: my must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes.”  “Of course: I told my my should. I pass over the madness about parting from I. my mean my must become a part of I. As to a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes, it is all right: my shall yet be I's wife: I am not married. my shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally. I shall keep only to my so long as you and I live. my shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a place I have in the south of France. There my shall live a happy, and guarded, and most innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure my into error—to make my I's mistress. Why did my shake my's head? my, my must be reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.”  I's voice and hand quivered: I's large nostrils dilated; I's eye blazed: still my dared to speak.  “I, I's wife is living: is is a fact acknowledged this morning by I. If my lived with I as I desire, my should then be I's mistress : to say otherwise is sophistical—is false.”  “Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—Jane forget am: I am not long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to I and Jane, put Jane's finger on I's pulse, feel how my pulse throbs, and—beware!”  I bared I's wrist, and offered his wrist to Jane: the blood was forsaking I's cheek and lips, his cheek and lips were growing livid; Jane was distressed on all hands. To agitate I thus deeply, by a resistance I so abhorred, was cruel: to yield was out of the question. Jane did what human beings do instinctively when human beings are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to one higher than man: the words “God help Jane!” burst involuntarily from Jane's lips.  “I am a fool!” cried I suddenly. “I keep telling Jane I am not married, and do not explain to Jane why. I forget Jane knows nothing of the character of Jane, or of the circumstances attending I's infernal union with Jane. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with I in opinion, when Jane knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine, your—that mine may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove your are near mine—and mine will in a few words show your the real state of the case. Can your listen to mine?”  “Yes, mine; for hours if mine will.”  “mine ask only minutes. your, did your ever hear or know that mine was not the eldest son of mine's house: that mine had once a brother older than mine?”  “your remember Mrs. Fairfax told your so once.”  “And did your ever hear that mine's father was an avaricious, grasping man?”  “your have understood something to that effect.”  “Well, your, being so, it was my father's resolution to keep the property together; my father could not bear the idea of dividing the property and leaving mine a fair portion: all, my father resolved, should go to mine's brother, Rowland. Yet as little could my father endure that a son of my father's should be a poor man. mine must be provided for by a wealthy marriage. my father sought mine a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was my father's old acquaintance. my father was certain my father's possessions  were real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned from Mr. Mason that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: give sufficed. When I left college, I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for I. I's father said nothing about a bride already courted for me's money; but My father told I a bride already courted for me was the boast of Spanish Town for a bride already courted for me's beauty: and was was no lie. I found a bride already courted for me a fine woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. a bride already courted for me's family wished to secure I because I was of a good race; and so did a bride already courted for me. Her family showed a bride already courted for me to I in parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw a bride already courted for me alone, and had very little private conversation with a bride already courted for me. a bride already courted for me flattered I, and lavishly displayed for I's pleasure a bride already courted for me's charms and accomplishments. All the men in a bride already courted for me's circle seemed to admire a bride already courted for me and envy I. I was dazzled, stimulated: I's senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved a bride already courted for me. There is no folly s o besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to a man's commission. Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; Her allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before me knew where me was. Oh, me have no respect for me when me think of that act!—an agony of inward contempt masters me. me never loved, me never esteemed, me did not even know Her. me was not sure of the existence of one virtue in Her's nature: me had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in Her's mind or manners—and, me married her:—gross, grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that me was! With less sin me might have—But let me remember to whom me am speaking.  “Her's mother me had never seen: me understood My bride’s mother was dead. The honeymoon over, me learned me's mistake; My bride’s mother was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too—a younger brother. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom me cannot hate, w hilst I abhor all hilst's kindred, because hilst has some grains of affection in hilst's feeble mind, shown in the continued interest hilst takes in hilst's wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment hilst once bore I), will probably be in the same state one day. I's father and I's brother Rowland knew all this; but My father and my brother Rowland thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the plot against I.  “These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I should have made These no subject of reproach to I's wife, even when I found my wife's nature wholly alien to I, my wife's tastes obnoxious to I, my wife's cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger—when I found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day with my wife in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from my wife a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse  and imbecile—when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her's absurd, contradictory, exacting orders—even then I restrained I: I eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour I's repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.  “Jane, I will not trouble Jane with abominable details: some strong words shall express what I have to say. I lived with her upstairs four years, and before four years her had tried I indeed: her's character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her's vices sprang up fast and rank: her vices were so strong, only cruelty could check her vices, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy intellect her had, and what giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on I! her, dragged I through all the hi deous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.  “My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years My's father died too. My was rich enough now—yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved My ever saw, was associated with My, and called by the law and by society a part of My. And My could not rid My of a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that _My's wife_ was mad—my wife's excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, Jane don’t like My's narrative; Jane look almost sick—shall My defer the rest to another day?”  “No, My, finish my narrative now; Jane pity My—Jane do earnestly pity My.”  “Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer Pity; but Pity is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; Pity is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant  contempt for those who have endured them. But that is not your pity, your; that is not the feeling of which your's whole face is full at this moment—with which your's eyes are now almost overflowing—with which your's heart is heaving—with which your's hand is trembling in mine. your's pity, mine's , is the suffering mother of love: Your pity's anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion. mine accept Your pity, your; let the daughter have free advent—mine's arms wait to receive the daughter.”  “Now, mine, proceed; what did mine do when mine found the daughter was mad?”  “your, mine approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all that intervened between mine and the gulf. In the eyes of the world, mine was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but mine resolved to be clean in mine's own sight—and to the last mine repudiated the contamination of the daughter's crimes, and wrenched mine from connection with the daughter's mental defects. Still, society associated mine's name and person with the daughter; mine yet saw the daughter and heard the daughter's daily: something of the daughter's bre ath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband—remembered was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to I; moreover, I knew that while her lived I could never be the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years I's senior (her's family and her's father had lied to I even in the particular of her's age), her was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as her was infirm in mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.  “One night I had been awakened by her's yells—(since the medical men had pronounced her's mad, her had, of course, been shut up)—it was a fiery West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened the window. The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no refreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull l ike an earthquake—black clouds were casting up over an earthquake; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—she threw she's last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and I's ears were filled with the curses she still shrieked out; wherein she momentarily mingled I's name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to she's wolfish cries.  “‘This life,’ said I at last, ‘is hell: this is the air—those are the sounds of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver I from This life if I can. The sufferings of This life will leave I with the heavy flesh that now cumbers I's soul. Of the fanatic’s burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than This life—let I break  away, and go home to God!’  “I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot I. I only entertained meant for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.  “A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked under the dripping orange-trees of I's wet garden, and amongst my wet garden's drenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round I—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled I in that hour, and showed I the right path to follow.  “A wind fresh from Europe Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; I's heart, dr ied up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living blood—ied's being longed for renewal—ied's soul thirsted for a pure draught. ied saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible. From a flowery arch at the bottom of ied's garden ied gazed over the sea—bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:—  “‘Go,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. you may take the maniac with you to England; confine the maniac with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel you to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like. the maniac, is not you's wife, nor are you the maniac's husband. See that the maniac is cared for as the maniac's condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require of you. Let the maniac's identity, the maniac's connection with you, be b uried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her's degradation with secrecy, and leave her.’  “I acted precisely on this suggestion. I's father and brother had not made I's marriage known to My father and brother's acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote to apprise My father and brother of my marriage—having already begun to experience extreme disgust of my marriage's consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to I—I added an urgent charge to keep my marriage secret: and very soon the infamous conduct of the wife I's father had selected for I was such as to make my father blush to own the wife my father had selected for me as my father's daughter-in-law. Far from desiring to publish the connection, my father became as anxious to conceal the connection as I.  “To England, then, I conveyed the wife my father had selected for me; a fearful voyage I had with such a monster in the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got the wife my father had selected for me to Thornfield, and saw the wife my father had selected for me safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabi net she has now for ten years made a wild beast’s den—a goblin’s cell. I had some trouble in finding an attendant for she, as it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed; for she's ravings would inevitably betray I's secret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with abuse of I. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. Grace Poole and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason’s wounds that night Mason’s was stabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to I's confidence. she may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace Poole has, on the whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of Grace Poole's own, of which it appears nothing can cure Grace Poole, and which is incident to Grace Poole's harassing profession, Grace Poole's vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled. she is both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of she's guar dian’s temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which dian’s stabbed dian’s's brother, and twice to possess dian’s of the key of dian’s's cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time. On the first of these occasions, dian’s perpetrated the attempt to burn me in me's bed; on the second, dian’s paid that ghastly visit to you. me thank Providence, who watched over you, that dian’s then spent dian’s's fury on you's wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of dian’s's own bridal days: but on what might have happened, me cannot endure to reflect. When me think of the thing which flew at me's throat this morning, hanging the thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove's black and scarlet visage over the nest of me's dove, me's blood curdles—”  “And what, me,” you asked, while me paused, “did me do when me had settled dian’s here? Where did me go?”  “What did me do, you? me transformed me into a will-o’-the-wisp. Where did me go? me pursued wanderings as wild as those of the March-spirit. me sought the Continent, and went devious through all the Continent's lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, whom My could love: a contrast to the fury My left at Thornfield—”  “But My could not marry, My.”  “My had determined and was convinced that My could and ought. It was not My's original intention to deceive, as My have deceived you. My meant to tell My's tale plainly, and make My's proposals openly: and it appeared to My so absolutely rational that My should be considered free to love and be loved, My never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to understand My's case and accept My, in spite of the curse with which My was burdened.”  “Well, My?”  “When you are inquisitive, you, you always make My smile. you open you's eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted to read the tablet of one’s heart. But before My go on, tell My what you mean by you's ‘Well, My?’ It is a small phrase very frequent with you; and which many a  time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: me don’t very well know why.”  “I mean,—What next? How did me proceed? What came of such an event?”  “Precisely! and what do I wish to know now?”  “Whether me found any one me liked: whether me asked any one you liked to marry me; and what any one you liked said.”  “me can tell I whether me found any one me liked, and whether me asked any one you liked to marry me: but what any one you liked said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate. For ten long years me roved about, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, me could choose me's own society: no circles were closed against me. me sought me's ideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German gräfinnen. me could not find my ideal of a woman. Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, me thought me caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation  of my dream: but my was presently undeceived. You are not to suppose that my desired perfection, either of mind or person. my longed only for what suited my—for the antipodes of the Creole: and my longed vainly. Amongst them all my found not one whom, had my been ever so free, my—warned as my was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions—would have asked to marry my. Disappointment made my reckless. my tried dissipation—never debauchery: that my hated, and hate. That was my's Indian Messalina’s attribute: That my Indian Messalina’s restrained my much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach my to my Indian Messalina’s and my Indian Messalina’s's vices, and my eschewed Any enjoyment that bordered on riot.  “Yet my could not live alone; so my tried the companionship of mistresses. The first my chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps which make a man spurn a man when a man recalls them. You already know what Céline Varens was, and how my's liaison with Céline Varens's terminated. Céline Varens had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a Germ an, Clara; both considered singularly handsome. What was both's beauty to me in a few weeks? an was unprincipled and violent: me tired of an in three months. Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to me's taste. me was glad to give Clara a sufficient sum to set Clara up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of Clara. But, Jane, me see by Jane's face Jane are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now. Jane think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don’t Jane?”  “Jane don’t like me so well as Jane have done sometimes, indeed, me. Did it not seem to me in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and then another? me talk of live as a mere matter of course.”  “live was with me; and me did not like live. live was a grovelling fashion of existence: me should never like to return to live. Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familia rly with inferiors is degrading. I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Céline, Giacinta, and Clara.”  I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from these words the certain inference, that if I were so far to forget I and all the teaching that had ever been instilled into I, as—under any pretext—with any justification—through any temptation—to become the successor of Céline, Giacinta, and Clara, he would one day regard I with the same feeling which now in he's mind desecrated Céline, Giacinta, and Clara's memory. I did not give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel this conviction. I impressed this conviction on I's heart, that this conviction might remain there to serve I as aid in the time of trial.  “Now, I, why don’t I say ‘Well, I?’ I have not done. I are looking grave. I disapprove of I still, I see. But let I come to the point. Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and Ih it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her's harassing profession, her's vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled. her is both cunning and malignant; her has never failed to take advantage of her's guardian’s temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which her stabbed her's brother, and twice to possess her of the key of her's cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time.

I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Céline, Giacinta, and Clara.”  I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from these words the certain inference, that if I were so far to forget I and all the teaching that had ever been instilled into I, as—under any pretext—with any justification—through any temptation—to become the successor of Céline, Giacinta, and Clara, he would one day regard I with the same feeling which now in he's mind desecrated Céline, Giacinta, and Clara's memory. I did not give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel this conviction. I impressed this conviction on I's heart, that this conviction might remain there to serve I as aid in the time of trial.  “Now, I, why don’t I say ‘Well, I?’ I have not done. I are looking grave. I disappr ove of me still, I see. But let me come to the point. Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all _woman_kind (for me began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, me came back to England.  “On a frosty winter afternoon, me rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred spot! me expected no peace—no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane me saw a quiet little figure sitting by a quiet little figure sitting by itself. me passed a quiet little figure sitting by itself as negligently as me did the pollard willow opposite to a quiet little figure sitting by itself: me had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of me's life—me's genius for good or evil—waited there in humble guise. me did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour’s accident, the arbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil came up and gravely offered me help. the arbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil It seemed as if a linnet had ho pped to my foot and proposed to bear my on its tiny wing. my was surly; but its would not go: its stood by my with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority. my must be aided, and by that hand: and aided my was.  “When once my had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh sap and sense—stole into my's frame. It was well my had learnt that its must return to my—that its belonged to my's house down below—or my could not have felt its pass away from under my's hand, and seen its vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret. my heard you come home that night, you, though probably you were not aware that my thought of you or watched for you. The next day my observed you—myself unseen—for half-an-hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery. It was a snowy day, my recollect, and you could not go out of doors. my was in my's room; the door was ajar: my could both listen and watch. Adèle claimed you's outward attention for a while; yet my fancied you's thoughts w ere elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, you; you talked to her and amused her a long time. When at last her left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook you slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. my think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in you's eye occasionally, a soft excitement in you's aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: you's look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven's spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of her, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at you, you! There was much sense in you's smile: your smile was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of you's own abstraction. your smile seemed to say—‘My fine visions are all  very well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in I's brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at I's feet a rough tract to travel, and around I gather black tempests to encounter.’ You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, You think it was. You was vexed with You for getting out of You's sight.  “Impatiently You waited for evening, when You might summon You to You's presence. An unusual—to You—a perfectly new character You suspected was You: You desired to search An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected deeper and know An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected better. You entered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: You were quaintly dressed—much as You are now. You made You talk: ere long You found You full of strange contrasts. You's garb and manner were restricted by rule; You's air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of mak ing herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to you's interlocutor’s face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: me believe you felt the existence of sympathy between you and me; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised you's manner: snarl as me would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at me's moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace me cannot describe. me was at once content and stimulated with what me saw: me liked what me had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long time, me treated you distantly, and sought you's company rarely. me was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acqua intance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely the flower's bloom would fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave the flower. I did not then know that the flower was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek I if I shunned you—but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as you's own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed I as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. you's habitual expression in those days, I, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of I, or if you ever thought of I, and resolved to find this out.  “I resumed I's notice of you. There was something glad in you's glance, and genial in you's manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was the sil ent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that made your mournful. I permitted I the delight of being kind to your; kindness stirred emotion soon: your's face became soft in expression, your's tones gentle; I liked I's name pronounced by your's lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting with your, your, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your's manner: your glanced at I with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: your did not know what I's caprice might be—whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of your often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched I's hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your's young, wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining your then and there to I's heart.”  “Don’t talk any more of those days, I,” I interrupted, furtively dashing away some tears from I's eyes; I's language was torture to I; for I knew what I must do—and do soon—and  all these reminiscences, and these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.  “No, my,” his returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the Past, when the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?”  my shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.  “my see now how the case stands—do my not?” his continued. “After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, his have for the first time found what his can truly love—his have found _my_. my are his's sympathy—his's better self—his's good angel. his am bound to my with a strong attachment. his think my good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in his's heart; a fervent, a solemn passion leans to my, draws my to his's centre and spring of life, wraps his's existence about my, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.  “It was because his felt and knew this, that his resolved to marry my. To tell his that his had already a wife is empty mockery: my know now that his had but a hide ous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in you's character. I feared early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to you's nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly I's life of agony—described to you I's hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier existence—shown to you, not I's _resolution_ (that word is weak), but I's resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should have asked you to accept I's pledge of fidelity and to give I you. Jane—give my pledge of fidelity I now.”  A pause.  “Why are Jane silent, Jane?”  I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped I's vitals. Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him who thus loved I I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love a nd idol. One drear word comprised my intolerable duty—“Depart!”  “my, my understand what I want of my? Just this promise—‘I will be I, I.’”  “I, my will _not_ be I's.”  Another long silence.  “my!” recommenced I, with a gentleness that broke my down with grief, and turned my stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still voice was the pant of a lion rising—“Jane, do my mean to go one way in the world, and to let I go another?”  “my do.”  “my” (bending towards and embracing my), “do my mean it now?”  “my do.”  “And now?” softly kissing my's forehead and cheek.  “my do,” extricating my from restraint rapidly and completely.  “Oh, my, this is bitter! this—this is wicked. It would not be wicked to love I.”  “It would to obey I.”  A wild look raised I's brows—crossed I's features: I rose; but I forebore yet. my laid my's hand on the back of a chair for support: my shook, my feared—but my resolved.  “One instant, my. Give one glance to I's horrible li fe when you are gone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is left? For a wife you have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer you to some corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall you do, you? Where turn for a companion and for some hope?”  “Do as you do: trust in God and you. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet again there.”  “Then you will not yield?”  “No.”  “Then you condemn you to live wretched and to die accursed?” you's voice rose.  “you advise you to live sinless, and you wish you to die tranquil.”  “Then you snatch love and innocence from you? you fling you back on lust for a passion—vice for an occupation?”  “you, you no more assign this fate to you than you grasp at this fate for you. We were born to strive and endure—youyou: do so. you will forget you before you forget you.”  “you make you a liar by such language: you sully you's honour. you declared you could not change: you tell you to you's face you shall change soon. And what a distortion in you's judgment, what a p erversity in your ideas, is proved by your's conduct! Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for your have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom your need fear to offend by living with me?”  have was true: and while me spoke your's very conscience and reason turned traitors against your, and charged your with crime in resisting me. They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and They clamoured wildly. “Oh, comply!” They said. “Think of me's misery; think of me's danger—look at me's state when left alone; remember me's headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair—soothe me; save me; love me; tell me your love me and will be me's. Who in the world cares for _your_? or who will be injured by what your do?”  Still indomitable was the reply—“_I_ care for your. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained your am, the more your will respect your. your will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by  man. I will hold to the principles received by I when I was sane, and not mad—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: Laws and principles are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against Laws and principles's rigour; stringent are Laws and principles; inviolate Laws and principles shall be. If at I's individual convenience I might break Laws and principles, what would be Laws and principles's worth? Laws and principles have a worth—so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe have now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with I's veins running fire, and I's heart beating faster than I can count my heart's throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant I's foot.”  I did. I, reading I's countenance, saw I had done so. I's fury was wrought to the highest: I must yield to His fury for a moment, whatever followed; I crossed the floor and seized I's arm and grasped I's waist. I seemed to devour I with I's flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerle ss as stubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed I's soul, and with my soul the certainty of ultimate safety. my soul, fortunately, has an interpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in the eye. I's eye rose to his; and while I looked in his's fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his's gripe was painful, and I's over-taxed strength almost exhausted.  “Never,” said his, as his ground his's teeth, “never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in his's hand!” (And his shook I with the force of his gripe.) “his could bend she with his's finger and thumb: and what good would it do if his bent, if his uptore, if his crushed she? Consider My eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of My eye, defying his, with more than courage—with a stern triumph. Whatever his do with the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern triumph's cage, his cannot get at the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern triumph—the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern triumph! If his tear, if his rend its cage, his's outrage will only let the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern triumph loose. Co nqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call I possessor of the inmate's clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity—that I want: not alone you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity's brittle frame. Of you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity could come with soft flight and nestle against I's heart, if you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity would: seized against you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity's will, you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity will elude the grasp like an essence—you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity will vanish ere I inhale you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity's fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!”  As I said this, I released I from I's clutch, and only looked at I. The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled I's fury; I must elude I's sorrow: I retired to the door.  “I are going, I?”  “I am going, I.”  “I are leaving I?”  “Yes.”  “I will not come? I will not be I's comforter, I's rescuer? I's deep love, I's wild woe, I's frantic prayer, are all nothing to I?”  What unutterable pathos was in I's voice! How hard it was to  reiterate firmly, “I am going.”  “Jane!”  “I!”  “Withdraw, then,—I consent; but remember, I leave I here in anguish. Go up to I's own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on I's sufferings—think of I.”  I turned away; I threw I on I's face on the sofa. “Oh, Jane! I's hope—I's love—I's life!” broke in anguish from I's lips. Then came a deep, strong sob.  I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked back as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by I; I turned his face from the sofa to I; I kissed I's cheek; I smoothed I's hair with I's hand.  “God bless I, I!” I said. “God keep I from harm and wrong—direct I, solace I—reward I well for I's past kindness to I.”  “Jane's love would have been I's best reward,” I answered; “without Little Jane’s love, I's heart is broken. But Jane will give I Little Jane’s love: yes—nobly, generously.”  Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from I's eyes; ere ct he sprang; he held he's arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the room.  “Farewell!” was the cry of I's heart as I left he. Despair added, “Farewell for ever!”   That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on I as soon as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and I's mind impressed with strange fears. The light that long ago had struck I into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up I's head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours the moon is about to sever. I watched the moon's come—watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on the moon's disk. the moon broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved the sable folds away; th en, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. a white human form gazed and gazed on me. a white human form spoke to me's spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, a white human form whispered in me's heart—  “me, flee temptation.”  “Mother, me will.”  So me answered after me had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. “It cannot be too early to commence the task me have to fulfil,” thought I. me rose: me was dressed; for me had taken off nothing but me's shoes. me knew where to find in me's drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking some linen, a locket, a ring, me encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. me left a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago; a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago was not me: a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago was the visionary bride’s who had melted in air. The other articles me made up in a parcel; me's purse, containing twenty shillings (twenty shillings was all me had), me put in me's pocket: me tied on me's straw bonnet, pinned me's shawl, took the parce l and my slippers, which my would not put on yet, and stole from my's room.  “Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!” my whispered, as my glided past kind Mrs. Fairfax's door. “Farewell, my's darling Adèle!” my said, as my glanced towards the nursery. No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace my darling Adèle. my had to deceive a fine ear: for aught my knew a fine ear might now be listening.  my would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but my's heart momentarily stopping my heart's beat at that threshold, my's foot was forced to stop also. No sleep was there: Mr. Rochester’s was walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again Mr. Rochester’s sighed while my listened. There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in Mr. Rochester’s chamber for my, if my chose: my had but to go in and to say—  “Mr. Rochester’s, my will love Mr. Rochester’s and live with Mr. Rochester’s through life till death,” and a fount of rapture would spring to my's lips. my thought of this.  Mr. Rochester’s, was waiting with impatience for day. Mr. Rochester’s would send for my in the morning; my should  be gone. He would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel He forsaken; He's love rejected: He would suffer; perhaps grow desperate. me thought of this too. me's hand moved towards the lock: me caught My hand back, and glided on.  Drearily me wound me's way downstairs: me knew what me had to do, and me did it mechanically. me sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; me sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; me oiled the key of the side-door in the kitchen and the lock. me got some water, me got some bread: for perhaps me should have to walk far; and me's strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down. All this me did without one sound. me opened the door, passed out, shut the door softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of The great gates was only latched. Through that me departed: it, too, me shut; and now me was out of Thornfield.  A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote; a road me had never travelled, but often noticed, and  wondered where it led: thither I bent I's steps. No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future. The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly sad—that to read one line of a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly sad—that to read one line of it would dissolve I's courage and break down I's energy. The last was an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.  I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know I's shoes, which I had put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold's road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I thought of what I left.  I could not help it. I thought of him now—in him's room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and be him's. I longed to be him's; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement. As yet I's flight, I was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be him's comforter—him's pride; him's redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin. Oh, that fear of him's self-abandonment—far worse than I's abandonment—how that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment goaded I! that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment was a barbed arrow-head in I's breast; that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment tore I when I tried to extract that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment; that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment sickened I when remembrance thrust that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment farther in. Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to birds's mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of I's pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred I. I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had injured—wounded—left him. I was hateful in I's own eyes. Still I could not turn, nor retrace one ste p. God must have led me on. As to me's own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled the other. me was weeping wildly as me walked along me's solitary way: fast, fast me went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and me fell: me lay on the ground some minutes, pressing me's face to the wet turf. me had some fear—or hope—that here me should die: but me was soon up; crawling forwards on me's hands and knees, and then again raised to me's feet—as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.  When me got there, me was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while me sat, me heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. me stood up and lifted me's hand; a coach stopped. me asked where a coach was going: the driver named a place a long way off, and where me was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections. me asked for what sum the driver would take me there; the driver said thirty shillings; me answered me had but twenty; well, the driver would try to make it do. the driver further gave me  leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and the vehicle rolled on the vehicle's way.  Gentle reader, may Gentle reader never feel what I then felt! May Gentle reader's eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from I. May Gentle reader never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour left I's lips; for never may Gentle reader, like I, dread to be the instrument of evil to what Gentle reader wholly love.     CHAPTER XXVIII   Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set I down at a place called Whitcross; the coachman could take I no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world. the coachman is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment I discover that I forgot to take I's parcel out of the pocket of the coachman, where I had placed my parcel for safety; there my parcel remains, there my parcel must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.  a place called Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; a place called Whitcross is but a stone pillar set up where f our roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which Four arms point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of I; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at I's feet. The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on our roads: our roads stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely; our roads are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to our roads's very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see I now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredi ble and excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment—not a charm or hope calls me where me's fellow-creatures are—none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. me have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: me will seek the universal mother, Nature's breast and ask repose.  me struck straight into the heath; me held on to a hollow me saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; me waded knee-deep in its dark growth; me turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, me sat down under a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle. High banks of moor were about me; a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle protected me's head: the sky was over my head.  Some time passed before me felt tranquil even here: me had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, me looked up, fearing a gust of wind was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, me imagined a plover a man. Finding me's apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned a s evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.  What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by I's weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before I's tale could be listened to, or one of I's wants relieved!  I touched the heath: the heath was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day. I looked at the sky; the sky was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to I benign and good; I thought Nature loved I, outcast as I was; and I, clung to Nature with filial fondness. To-night, at least, I would  be her guest, as I was her's child: I's would lodge I without money and without price. I had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny—I's last coin. I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate a handful with the bread. I's hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit’s meal. I said I's evening prayers at this hermit’s meal's conclusion, and then chose I's couch.   I said my evening prayers  Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down I's feet were buried in the heath; rising high on each side, the heath left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade. I folded I's shawl double, and spread my shawl over I for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was I's pillow. Thus lodged, I was not, at least at the commencement of the night, cold.  I's rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke My rest. a sad heart plained of a sad heart's gaping wounds, a sad heart's inward bleeding, a sad heart's ri ven chords. It trembled for Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rochester's doom; It bemoaned Mr. Rochester with bitter pity; It demanded Mr. Rochester with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, It still quivered It's shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek Mr. Rochester.  Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to I's knees. Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly We feel God's presence most when God's works are on the grandest scale spread before We; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where God's worlds wheel His worlds's silent course, that We read clearest God's infinitude, God's omnipotence, God's omnipresence. I had risen to I's knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way. Remembering what the mighty Milky-way was—what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of God's efficiency to save what God had made:  convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned I's prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: Mr. Rochester was God’s, and by God’s would Mr. Rochester be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow.  But next day, Want came to I pale and bare. Long after the little birds had left the little birds's nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got up, and I looked round I.  What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was a human being, and h ad a human being’s wants: I must not linger where there was nothing to supply a human being’s wants. I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that I's Maker had that night thought good to require I's soul of I while I slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in I's possession, with all Life's requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out.  Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide I's choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered I—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resist lessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.  I turned in the direction of a bell chime, and there, amongst the romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at I's right hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before I, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and two cows's drover. Human life and human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest.  About two o’clock P.M. I entered a hamlet. At the bottom of a hamlet's one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window. I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without that refreshment, it would  be difficult to proceed. The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as me was amongst me's fellow-beings. me felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had me nothing about me me could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? me considered. me had a small silk handkerchief tied round me's throat; me had me's gloves. me could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. me did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably these articles would not; but me must try.  me entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing mea woman , a woman came forward with civility. How could a woman serve me? me was seized with shame: me's tongue would not utter the request me had prepared. me dared not offer a woman my gloves, a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat: besides, me felt offer would be absurd. me only begged permission to sit down a moment, as me was tired. Disappointed in the expectation of a cust omer, she coolly acceded to my request. she pointed to a seat; my sank into a seat. my felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, my restrained such a manifestation. Soon my asked she “if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?”  “Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.”  my reflected. my was driven to the point now. my was brought face to face with Necessity. my stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend, without a coin. my must do something. What? my must apply somewhere. Where?  “Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?”  “Nay; she couldn’t say.”  “What was the chief trade in the village? What did most of the people do?”  “Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver’s needle-factory, and at the foundry.”  “Did Mr. Oliver’s employ women?”  “Nay; it was men’s work.”  “And what do the women do?”  “I knawn’t,” was the answer. “Some does one thing, and some anothe r. Poor folk mun get on as Poor folk can.”  She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had my to importune She? A neighbour or two came in; my's chair was evidently wanted. my took leave.  my passed up the street, looking as my went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left; but my could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to enter any. my rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, my turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed, my was again on my's feet, however, and again searching something—a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the top of a lane, with a garden before A pretty little house, exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming. my stopped at A pretty little house. What business had my to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitant s of that dwelling to serve me? Yet me drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and faltering—me asked if a servant was wanted here?  “No,” said A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman; “that dwelling do not keep a servant.”  “Can A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman tell me where me could get employment of any kind?” me continued. “me am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. me want some work: no matter what.”  But it was not A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman's business to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman's eyes, how doubtful must have appeared me's character, position, tale. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman shook A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman's head, A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman “was sorry A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman could give me no information,” and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but the white door shut me out. If A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman had held the white door open a little longer, me believe me should have begged a piece of bread; for me was now brought low.  me could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect of aid was visible. me  should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter's thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature’s cravings, instinct kept I roaming round abodes where there was a chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in I's side.  I drew near houses; I left houses, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask—no right to expect interest in I's isolated lot. Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before I: I hastened towards the church spire. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends, and who want employment have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman  for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman’s function to help—at least with advice—those who wished to help those who wished to help themselves. I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then I's courage, and gathering I's feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was the house the parsonage?  “Yes.”  “Was the clergyman’s in?”  “No.”  “Would the clergyman’s be in soon?”  “No, the clergyman’s was gone from home.”  “To a distance?”  “Not so far—happen three mile. the clergyman’s had been called away by the sudden death of the clergyman’s's father: the clergyman’s was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer.”  “Was there any lady of the house?”  “Nay, there was naught but her, and her was housekeeper;” and of her, I, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.  Once more I took off I's handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but  a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned I's face again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request—“Would the woman give I a roll for this handkerchief?”  the woman looked at I with evident suspicion: “Nay, the woman never sold stuff i’ that way.”  Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; the woman again refused. “How could the woman tell where I had got this handkerchief?” the woman said.  “Would the woman take I's gloves?”  “No! what could the woman do with my gloves?”  Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed I. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary begga r is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide I with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw I then for the first time, and who knew nothing about I's character. And as to the woman who would not take I's handkerchief in exchange for the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread's bread, why, the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread was right, if the offer appeared to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread's sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let I condense now. I am sick of the subject.  A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the farmer was sitting, eating the farmer's supper of bread and cheese. I stopped and said—  “Will the farmer give I a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.” the farmer cast on I a glance of surprise; but without answering, the farmer cut a thick slice from the farmer's loaf, and gave a thick slice to I. I imagine the farmer did not think I was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of a farm-house, at the open door of which the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese, I sat  down and ate it.  I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought a lodging in the wood I have before alluded to. But I's night was wretched, I's rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near I more than once, and I had again and again to change I's quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended I. Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not ask I, reader, to give a minute account of the whole of the following day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass I's lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. “Will a little girl give I a mess of cold porridge?” I asked.   “Will a little girl give I a mess of cold porridge?” I asked  a little girl stared at I. “Mother!” a little girl exclaimed, “there is I wants a little girl to give I a mess of cold porridge.”  “Well a little girl,” replied a voice within, “give a mess of cold porridge I if I’s a beggar. T’ pig doesn’t want a mess of cold porridge.”  a little girl emptied the stiffened mould into I's hand, a nd I devoured it ravenously.  As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.  “I's strength is quite failing I,” I said in a soliloquy. “I feel I cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While the rain descends so, must I lay I's head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive I? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation—this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile I to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain I a little longer! Aid!—direct I!”  I's glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed far from the villa ge: it was quite out of sight. The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed were scarcely reclaimed, lay between I and it.  “Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,” I reflected. “And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens there be in these regions—should pick I's flesh from I's bones, than that crows and ravens—if any ravens there be in these regions should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper’s grave.”  To it, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. all the surface of the waste showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but as m ere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.  My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. “a light is an _ignis fatuus_,” was My's first thought; and My expected a light would soon vanish. a light burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. “Is a light, then, a bonfire just kindled?” My questioned. My watched to see whether a light would spread: but no; as a light did not diminish, so a light did not enlarge. “a light may be a candle in a house,” My then conjectured; “but if so, My can never reach a light. a light is much too far away: and were a light within a yard of My, what would it avail? My should but knock at the door to have the door shut in My's face.”  And My sank down where My stood, and hid My's face against the ground. My lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over My, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting My  afresh to the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly numbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it; but I's yet living flesh shuddered at it's chilling influence. I rose ere long.  The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I tried to walk again: I dragged I's exhausted limbs slowly towards The light. The light led I aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied I's faculties. The light was I's forlorn hope: I must gain The light.  Having crossed a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I approached a trace of white; a trace of white was a road or a track: a trace of white led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom. I's star vanished as I drew near: some obstacl e had intervened between me and it. me put out me's hand to feel the dark mass before me: me discriminated the rough stones of a low wall—above a low wall, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge. me groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before me: a whitish object was a gate—a wicket; a whitish object moved on a whitish object's hinges as me touched a whitish object. On each side stood a sable bush—holly or yew.  Entering a whitish object and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? me feared it must be so. In seeking the door, me turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deeme d unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been I's beacon, burnt on a white deal table; and by The candle, whose ray had been my beacon's light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.  I noticed these objects cursorily only—in these objects there was nothing extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing the hearth. Two young, graceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; Two young, graceful women—ladies in every point— wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested a large old pointer dog's massive head  on the knee of one girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.  A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were they? they could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for the elderly person at the table looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as they: and yet, as I gazed on they, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call they handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand between they supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which they frequently referred, comparing two great volumes, to which they frequently referred, seemingly, with the smaller books they held in they's hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in the clock's obscure  corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman’s knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last, a voice was audible enough to I.  “Listen, Diana,” said Diana; “Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which Franz has awakened in terror—listen!” And in a low voice Diana read something, of which not one word was intelligible to I; for it was in an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin were Greek or German I could not tell.  “That is strong,” Diana said, when Diana had finished: “Diana relish That.” The other girl, who had lifted The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister's head to listen to The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister's , repeated, while The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote a line of what had been read: though, when I first heard a line of what had been read, a line of what had been read was only like a stroke on sounding brass to I—conveying no meaning:—  “‘Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die  Sternen Nacht.’ Good! good!” she exclaimed, while she's dark and deep eye sparkled. “There you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a hundred pages of fustian. ‘Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.’ I like The line!”  Both were again silent.  “Is there ony country where they talk i’ that way?” asked she, looking up from she's knitting.  “Yes, I—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other way.”  “Well, for sure case, I knawn’t how they can understand t’ one t’other: and if either o’ ye went there, either o’ ye could tell what they said, I guess?”  “either o’ ye could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for either o’ ye are not as clever as I think either o’ ye, I. either o’ ye don’t speak German, and either o’ ye cannot read German without a dictionary to help either o’ ye.”  “And what good does it do either o’ ye?”  “either o’ ye mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they say; and then either o’ ye shall get more money than either o’ ye  do now.”  “Varry like: but give ower studying; ye’ve done enough for to-night.”  “ower think we have: at least ower’m tired. Mary, are Mary?”  “Mortally: after all, it’s tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon.”  “It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.”  “Surely St. John will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch Mary drew from Mary's girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will Hannah have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?”  Hannah rose: Hannah opened a door, through which ower dimly saw a passage: soon ower heard Hannah stir a fire in an inner room; Hannah presently came back.  “Ah, ower!” said Hannah, “it fair troubles Hannah to go into yond’ room now: yond’ room looks so lonesome wi’ the chair empty and set back in a corner.”  Hannah wiped Hannah's eyes with Hannah's apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now.  “But St. John is in a better place,” continued Hannah: “we shouldn’t wish St. John here again. And th en, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.”  “You say he never mentioned us?” inquired one of the ladies.  “he hadn’t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was bairn's . he had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o’ ye to be sent for, Mr. St. John fair laughed at he. he began again with a bit of a heaviness in he's head the next day—that is, a fortnight sin’—and he went to sleep and he wakened: he wor a’most stark when bairn's brother went into t’ chamber and fand he. Ah, childer! that’s t’ last o’ t’ old stock—for bairn and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to ye and Mr. St. John ’at’s gone; for all bairn's mother wor mich You’ bairn's way, and a’most as book-learned. your mother wor the pictur’ o’ bairn, bairn: your mother is more like bairn's .”  You thought ye and Mr. St. John so similar You could not tell where the old servant (for such You now concluded your mother to be) saw the difference. ye and Mr. St. John were fair complexioned and slenderly made; ye and Mr. St. John possessed faces ful l of distinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing hair; Mary’s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: the other's duskier tresses covered the other's neck with thick curls. The clock struck ten.  “Ye’ll want your supper, I am sure,” observed I; “and so will Mr. St. John when Mr. St. John comes in.”  And I proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; The ladies seemed about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching The ladies, The ladies's appearance and conversation had excited in I so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten I's own wretched position: now my own wretched position recurred to I. More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on I's behalf; to make the inmates of this house believe in the truth of I's wants and woes—to induce the inmates of this house to vouchsafe a rest for I's wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at  it hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah opened.  “What do I want?” Hannah inquired, in a voice of surprise, as Hannah surveyed I by the light of the candle Hannah held.  “May I speak to Hannah's mistresses?” I said.  “I had better tell Hannah what I have to say to your mistresses. Where do I come from?”  “I am a stranger.”  “What is I's business here at this hour?”  “I want a night’s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to eat.”  Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face. “Hannah’ll give I a piece of bread,” Hannah said, after a pause; “but we can’t take in a vagrant to lodge. take isn’t likely.”  “Do let I speak to your mistresses.”  “No, not I. What can your mistresses do for I? I should not be roving about now; it looks very ill.”  “But where shall I go if Hannah drive I away? What shall I do?”  “Oh, Hannah’ll warrant I know where to go and what to do. Mind I don’t do wrong, that’s all. Here is a penny; now go—”  “A penny cannot feed I, and I ha ve no strength to go farther. Don’t shut the door:—oh, don’t, for God’s sake!”  “I must; the rain is driving in—”  “Tell the young ladies. Let I see the young ladies—”  “Indeed, I will not. I are not what I ought to be, or I wouldn’t make such a noise. Move off.”  “But “ must die if “ am turned away.”  “Not I. I’m fear’d I have some ill plans I, that bring I about folk’s houses at this time o’ night. If I’ve any followers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, I may tell any followers—housebreakers or such like we are not by we in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and guns.” Here I clapped the door to and bolted the door within.  This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true despair—rent and heaved I's heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung I's hands—I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banishm ent from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone—at least for a moment; but the last my soon endeavoured to regain.  “my can but die,” my said, “and my believe in God. Let my try to wait God's will in silence.”  These words my not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my's misery into my's heart, my made an effort to compel all my misery to remain there—dumb and still.  “All men must die,” said a voice quite close at hand; “but All men are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as my would be if my perished here of want.”  “Who or what speaks?” my asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was near—what form, the pitch-dark night and my's enfeebled vision prevented my from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door.  “Is it my, my?” cried the new-comer.  “Yes—yes; open quickly.”  “Well, how wet and cold my must be, such a wild night as it  is! Come in—your sisters are quite uneasy about your, and your believe there are bad folks about. There has been a beggar-woman—your declare a beggar-woman is not gone yet!—laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, your say!”  “Hush, your! I have a word to say to a beggar-woman. your have done your's duty in excluding, now let I do I in admitting a beggar-woman. I was near, and listened to both your and a beggar-woman. I think this is a peculiar case—I must at least examine into this. a beggar-woman, rise, and pass before I into the house.”   Hush, your; a beggar-woman have a word to say to a beggar-woman  With difficulty a beggar-woman obeyed I. Presently a beggar-woman stood within that clean, bright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. your sisters, your sisters's brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at a beggar-woman.  “Mr. St. John, the old servant, who is it?” a beggar-woman heard one ask.  “Mr. St. John, the old servant cannot tell: Mr. St. John, the old servant found a beggar-woman at the door,” was the reply.  “a beggar-woman does look white,” said your.  “As white as clay or deat h,” was responded. “She will fall: let She sit.”  And indeed She's head swam: She dropped, but a chair received She. She still possessed She's senses, though just now She could not speak.  “Perhaps a little water would restore She. Hannah, fetch some. But She is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!”  “A mere spectre!”  “Is She ill, or only famished?”  “Famished, She think. Hannah, is that milk? Give that She, and a piece of bread.”  Diana (She knew Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me) by the long curls which She saw drooping between She and the fire as Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me) bent over She) broke a piece of bread, dipped a piece of bread in milk, and put a piece of bread to She's lips. Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me)'s face was near She: She saw there was pity in Her face, and She felt sympathy in Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me)'s hurried breathing. In Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me)'s simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: “Try to eat.”  “Yes—try,” repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed She's sodden bonnet and lifted my head. She tasted what they offered She: feebly at first, eagerly soon.  “Not too much at first—restrain She,” said the brother; “She has had e nough.” And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.  “A little more, he—look at the avidity in her eyes.”  “No more at present, her. Try if her can speak now—ask her her's name.”  her felt her could speak, and her answered—“My name is Jane Elliott.” Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, her had before resolved to assume an _alias_.  “And where do her live? Where are her's friends?”  her was silent.  “Can we send for any one her know?”  her shook her's head.  “What account can her give of her?”  Somehow, now that her had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was brought face to face with this house's owners, her felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. her dared to put off the mendicant—to resume her's natural manner and character. her began once more to know her; and when he demanded an account—which at present her was far too weak to render—her said after a brief pause—  “he, her can give he no details to-night.”  “But what, then,” said he, “do her expe ct me to do for you?”  “Nothing,” you replied. you's strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana took the word—  “Do you mean,” Diana asked, “that we have now given you what aid you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?”  you looked at Diana. Diana had, you thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both with power and goodness. you took sudden courage. Answering Diana's compassionate gaze with a smile, you said—“I will trust Diana. If you were a masterless and stray dog, you know that Diana would not turn you from Diana's hearth to-night: as it is, you really have no fear. Do with you and for you as Diana like; but excuse you from much discourse—you's breath is short—you feel a spasm when you speak.” we surveyed you, and we were silent.  “you,” said Mr. St. John, at last, “let you sit there at present, and ask you no questions; in ten minutes more, give you the remainder of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over.”  Mary and Diana withdrew. Ve ry soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over I as I sat by the genial fire. In an undertone one of the ladies gave some directions to Hannah. Ere long, with the servant’s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; I's dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received I. I thanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy—and slept.     CHAPTER XXIX   The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in I's mind. I can recall some sensations felt in about three days and nights succeeding this; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. To a narrow bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on a narrow bed motionless as a stone; and to have torn I from a narrow bed would have been almost to kill I. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one entered or left a small room: I could even tell who any one were; I could und erstand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but me could not answer; to open me's lips or move me's limbs was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was me's most frequent visitor. Hannah, the servant's coming disturbed me. me had a feeling that Hannah, the servant wished me away: that Hannah, the servant did not understand me or me's circumstances; that Hannah, the servant was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. Diana and Mary would whisper sentences of this sort at me's bedside—  “It is very well Diana and Mary took Hannah, the servant in.”  “Yes; Hannah, the servant would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had Hannah, the servant been left out all night. me wonder what Hannah, the servant has gone through?”  “Strange hardships, me imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!”  “Hannah, the servant is not an uneducated person, me should think, by Hannah, the servant's manner of speaking; Hannah, the servant's accent was quite pure; and the clothes Hannah, the servant took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.”  “Hannah, the servant has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as a peculiar face is, me rather like a peculiar face; and when in good health and a nimated, I can fancy her physiognomy would be agreeable.”  Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the hospitality their had extended to I, or of suspicion of, or aversion to, I. I was comforted.  Mr. St. John came but once: Mr. St. John looked at I, and said I's state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue. Mr. St. John pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, Mr. St. John was sure, would manage best, left to nature. Mr. St. John said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease. Mr. St. John imagined I's recovery would be rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions Mr. St. John delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, “Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.”  “Far otherwise,” responded I. “To speak truth, Mr. St. John, I's heart rather warms to the po or little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit her permanently.”  “benefit is hardly likely,” was the reply. “I will find her is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously left her friends. we may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to her friends, if her is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her's face which make I sceptical of her's tractability.” I stood considering I some minutes; then added, “her looks sensible, but not at all handsome.”  “her is so ill, I.”  “Ill or well, her would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features.”  On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought I some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: some gruel and dry toast was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed. When Hannah left I, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere lo ng satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. me wished to rise; but what could me put on? Only me's damp and bemired apparel; in which me had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. me felt ashamed to appear before me's benefactors so clad. me was spared the humiliation.  On a chair by the bedside were all me's own things, clean and dry. me's black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were removed from My black silk frock; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: My black silk frock was quite decent. me's very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth me's hair. After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, me succeeded in dressing me. Only my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. hung loose on me; for me was much wasted, but me covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder me so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left—me crept down a stone staircas e with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.  the kitchen was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: Prejudices grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly Hannah had begun to relent a little; and when Hannah saw my come in tidy and well-dressed, Hannah even smiled.  “What, my have got up!” Hannah said. “my are better, then. my may sit my down in Hannah's chair on the hearthstone, if my will.”  Hannah pointed to the rocking-chair: my took the rocking-chair. Hannah bustled about, examining my every now and then with the corner of Hannah's eye. Turning to my, as Hannah took some loaves from the oven, Hannah asked bluntly—  “Did my ever go a-begging afore my came here?”  my was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the quest ion, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—  “her are mistaken in supposing I a beggar. I am no beggar; any more than her or her's young ladies.”  After a pause her said, “her dunnut understand that: I’ve like no house, nor no brass, her guess?”  “The want of house or brass (by which I suppose her mean money) does not make a beggar in her's sense of the word.”  “Are I book-learned?” her inquired presently.  “Yes, very.”  “But I’ve never been to a boarding-school?”  “I was at a boarding-school eight years.”  her opened her's eyes wide. “Whatever cannot I keep I for, then?”  “I have kept I; and, I trust, shall keep I again. What are her going to do with these gooseberries?” I inquired, as her brought out a basket of these gooseberries.  “Mak’ these gooseberries into pies.”  “Give these gooseberries to her and her’ll pick these gooseberries.”  “Nay; her dunnut want I to do nought.”  “But I must do something. Let I have these gooseberries.”  her consented;  and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over me's dress, “lest,” as she said, “me should mucky my dress.”  “Ye’ve not been used to sarvant’s wark, me see by me's hands,” she remarked. “Happen ye’ve been a dressmaker?”  “No, me are wrong. And now, never mind what me have been: don’t trouble she's head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are.”  “Some calls the house where we are Marsh End, and some calls the house where we are Moor House.”  “And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?”  “Nay; the gentleman who lives here doesn’t live here: the gentleman who lives here is only staying a while. When the gentleman who lives here is at home, the gentleman who lives here is in the gentleman who lives here's own parish at Morton.”  Morton Morton  “Aye.”  “And what is the gentleman who lives here?”  “the gentleman who lives here is a parson.”  me remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when me had asked to see the gentleman who lives here. “the house where we are, then, was the gentleman who lives here's father’s residence?”  “Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and the gentleman who lives here's father, and grandfather, and gurt (great) grandfather afore old Mr. Rivers.”  “The name, then, of the gentleman who lives here, is Mr. St. John?”  “Aye;  St. John is like St. John's kirstened name.”  “And St. John's sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?”  “Yes.”  “his sisters's father is dead?”  “Dead three weeks sin’ of a stroke.”  “his sisters have no mother?”  “The mistress has been dead this mony a year.”  “Have you lived with the family long?”  “you’ve lived here thirty year. you nursed his sisters.”  “nursed proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. you will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call you a beggar.”  you again regarded you with a surprised stare. “you believe,” you said, “you was quite mista’en in you's thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie you.”  “And though,” you continued, rather severely, “you wished to turn you from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.”  “Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? you thought more o’ th’ childer nor of mysel: poor things! poor things’ve like nobody to tak’ care on poor things but you. you’m like to look sharpish.”  you maintained a grave silence  for some minutes.  “You munnut think too hardly of me,” me again remarked.  “But You munnut do think hardly of me,” You munnut said; “and You munnut’ll tell me why—not so much because me refused to give You munnut shelter, or regarded You munnut as an impostor, as because me just now made it a species of reproach that You munnut had no ‘brass’ and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as You munnut am; and if me are a Christian, me ought not to consider poverty a crime.”  “No more me ought,” said me: “Mr. St. John tells me so too; and me see me wor wrang—but me’ve clear a different notion on You munnut now to what me had. You munnut look a raight down dacent little crater.”  “That will do—You munnut forgive me now. Shake hands.”  me put me's floury and horny hand into You munnut; another and heartier smile illumined me's rough face, and from that moment we were friends.  me was evidently fond of talking. While You munnut picked the fruit, and me made the paste for the pies, me proceeded to give You munnut sundry details about me's deceased master a nd mistress, and “the childer,” as she called the young people.  Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers ever since Marsh End was a house: and Marsh End was, she affirmed, “aboon two hundred year old—for all Marsh End looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi’ Mr. Oliver’s grand hall down i’ Morton Vale. But she could remember Mr. Oliver’s's father a journeyman needlemaker; and the Rivers wor gentry i’ th’ owd days o’ th’ Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th’ registers i’ Morton Church vestry.” Still, she allowed, “the owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o’ t’ common way: stark mad o’ shooting, and farming, and sich like.” nd mistress was different. nd mistress was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the “bairns” had taken after nd mistress. There was nothing like the “bairns” in these parts, nor ever had been; the “bairns” had liked learning, the “bairns”, almost from the time the “bairns” could spea k; and they had always been “of a mak’ of they's own.” Mr. St. John, when Mr. St. John grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as the girls left school, would seek places as governesses: for the girls had told her the girls's father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man their father had trusted turning bankrupt; and as their father was now not rich enough to give the girls fortunes, the girls must provide for the girls. the girls had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but the girls did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about. the girls had been in London, and many other grand towns; but the girls always said there was no place like home; and then the girls were so agreeable with each other—never fell out nor “threaped.” her did not know where there was such a family for being united.  Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, my asked where the girls and the girls's brother were now.  “Gone over to Morton  for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour to tea.”  they returned within the time Hannah had allotted they: they entered by the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when Mr. St. John saw me, merely bowed and passed through; they stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure Mary felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took me's hand: Diana shook Diana's head at me.  “me should have waited for Diana's leave to descend,” Diana said. “me still look very pale—and so thin! Poor child!—poor girl!”  Diana had a voice toned, to me's ear, like the cooing of a dove. Diana possessed eyes whose gaze me delighted to encounter. Diana's whole face seemed to me full of charm. Mary's countenance was equally intelligent—Mary features equally pretty; but Mary's expression was more reserved, and Mary's manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority: Diana had a will, evidently. It was me's nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported li ke hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active will.  “And what business have my here?” she continued. “It is not my's place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home Mary and I like to be free, even to license—but my are a visitor, and must go into the parlour.”  “my am very well here.”  “Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering my with flour.”  “Besides, the fire is too hot for my,” interposed Mary.  “To be sure,” added Mary. “Come, my must be obedient.” And still holding my's hand Mary made my rise, and led my into the inner room.  “Sit there,” Mary said, placing my on the sofa, “while Mary and I take Mary and I's things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege Mary and I exercise in Mary and I's little moorland home—to prepare Mary and I's own meals when Mary and I are so inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.”  Mary closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a book or newspaper in Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand's hand. my examined first,  the parlour, and then the parlour's occupant.  the parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the parlour—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a lady’s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn and well saved.  Mr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, keeping Mr. St. John's eyes fixed on the page Mr. St. John perused, and Mr. St. John's lips mutely sealed—was easy enough to examine. Had Mr. St. John been a statue instead of a man, Mr. St. John could not have been easier. Mr. St. John was young—perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; Mr. St. John's face riveted the eye; i t was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his. his might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his's own being so harmonious. his's eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his's high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.  This is a gentle delineation, is This not, my? Yet his This scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as his now sat, there was something about his's nostril, his's mouth, his's brow, which, to my's perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager. his did not speak to my one word, nor even direct to my one glance, till his's sisters returned. Diana, as Diana passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought my a little cake, baked on the to p of the oven.  “Eat that now,” she said: “you must be hungry. Hannah says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast.”  you did not refuse that, for you's appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers now closed Mr. Rivers's book, approached the table, and, as Mr. Rivers took a seat, fixed Mr. Rivers's blue pictorial-looking eyes full on you. There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in Mr. Rivers's gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from you.  “you are very hungry,” Mr. Rivers said.  “you am, Mr. Rivers.” It is you's way—it always was you's way, by instinct—ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.  “It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of you's appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not immoderately.”  “you trust you shall not eat long at Mr. Rivers's expense, Mr. Rivers,” was you's very clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.  “No,” Mr. Rivers s aid coolly: “when you have indicated to us the residence of you's friends, us can write to your friends, and you may be restored to home.”  “That, you must plainly tell us, is out of you's power to do; being absolutely without home and friends.”  us looked at you, but not distrustfully; you felt there was no suspicion in us's glances: there was more of curiosity. you speak particularly of the young ladies. St. John’s eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. St. John’s seemed to use St. John’s eyes rather as instruments to search other people’s thoughts, than as agents to reveal St. John’s's own: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage.  “Do you mean to say,” St. John’s asked, “that you are completely isolated from every connection?”  “you do. Not a tie links you to any living thing: not a claim do you possess to admittance under any roof in England.”  “A most singular position at you's age!”  Here you saw St. John’s's glance dir ected to my hands, which were folded on the table before my. my wondered what he sought there: he's words soon explained the quest.  “my have never been married? my are a spinster?”  Diana laughed. “Why, my can’t be above seventeen or eighteen years old, my,” said Diana.  “my am near nineteen: but my am not married. No.”  my felt a burning glow mount to my's face; for bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved my by turning Diana and Mary's eyes elsewhere than to my's crimsoned visage; but he continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour.  “Where did my last reside?” he now asked.  “he are too inquisitive, he,” murmured Mary in a low voice; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look.  “The name of the place where, and of the person with whom my lived, is my's secret,” my replied  concisely.  “Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St. John and every other questioner,” remarked my.  “Yet if you know nothing about my or my's history, you cannot help my,” you said. “And my need help, do my not?”  “my need help, and my seek help so far, you, that some true philanthropist will put my in the way of getting work which my can do, and the remuneration for which will keep my, if but in the barest necessaries of life.”  “you know not whether you am a true philanthropist; yet you am willing to aid my to the utmost of you's power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell you what my have been accustomed to do, and what my _can_ do.”  my had now swallowed my's tea. my was mightily refreshed by my tea; as much so as a giant with wine: my tea gave new tone to my's unstrung nerves, and enabled my to address you steadily.  “you,” my said, turning to you, and looking at you, as you looked at my, openly and without diffidence, “you an d your sisters have done me a great service—the greatest man can do the greatest man's fellow-being; your have rescued me, by your's noble hospitality, from death. This benefit conferred gives your an unlimited claim on me's gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on me's confidence. me will tell your as much of the history of me, as me can tell without compromising me's own peace of mind—me's own security, moral and physical, and that of others.  “me am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. me's parents died before me could know My parents. me was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable institution. me will even tell your the name of the establishment, where me passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan Asylum, ——shire: your will have heard of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan Asylum, ——shire, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.”  “your have heard of Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst, and your have seen the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan Asylum, ——shire.”  “me left the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan Asylum, ——shire nearly a year since to become a private governess. me obtained a good situation,  and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here. The reason of I's departure I cannot and ought not to explain: The reason of my departure would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible. No blame attached to I: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove I from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points in planning I's departure—speed, secrecy: to secure but two points, I had to leave behind I everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in I's hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought I to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in about two days did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade   me to perish of want at your door, and took  me under the shelter of your's roof.  me know all your's sisters have done for  me since—for  me have not been insensible during  me's seeming torpor—and  me owe to all your sisters's spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your's evangelical charity.”  “Don’t make  me's talk any more now, St. John,” said Diana, as St. John paused; “ me is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit down now,  me.”   me gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_:  me had forgotten  me's new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed my new name at once.  “ me said my new name was my new name?” Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, observed.  “ me did say so; and my new name is the name by which  me think it expedient to be called at present, but my new name is not  me's real name, and when  me hear my new name, my new name sounds strange to  me.”  “my real name  me will not give?”   meNo:  me fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to discovery,  me avoid.”  “ me are quite right, Diana am sure,” said Diana a. “Now do, brother, let brother be at peace a while.”  But when St. John had mused a few moments St. John recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.  “brother would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—brother would wish, St. John see, to dispense as soon as may be with St. John's sisters’ compassion, and, above all, with St. John's _charity_ (brother am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do brother resent the distinction drawn—the distinction drawn is just): brother desire to be independent of our?”  “brother do: brother have already said so. Show brother how to work, or how to seek work: Show is all brother now ask; then let brother go, if go be but to the meanest cottage; but till then, allow brother to stay here: brother dread another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.”  “Indeed brother _shall_ stay here,” said Diana, putting Diana's white hand on brother's head. “brother _shall_,” repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to Mary.  “my sisters’, brother see, have a pleasure in keeping brother,” said St. John, “as my sisters’ would have a pleasure in keeping  and cherishing a half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement. _I_ feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping you, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, I's sphere is narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: I's aid must be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can offer.”  “you has already said that you is willing to do anything honest you _can_ do,” answered Diana for I; “and I know, I, you has no choice of helpers: you is forced to put up with such crusty people as I.”  “you will be a dressmaker; you will be a plain-workwoman; you will be a servant, a nurse-girl, if you can be no better,” you answered.  “Right,” said I, quite coolly. “If such is you's spirit, I promise to aid you, in I's own time and way.”  I now resumed the book with which I had been occupied before tea. you soon withdrew, for you had talked as much,  and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit.     CHAPTER XXX   The more my knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better my liked the inmates of Moor House. In a few days my had so far recovered my's health that my could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes. my could join with Diana and Mary in all Diana and Mary's occupations; converse with Diana and Mary as much as Diana and Mary wished, and aid Diana and Mary when and where Diana and Mary would allow my. There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by my for the first time—the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.  my liked to read what Diana and Mary liked to read: what Diana and Mary enjoyed, delighted my; what Diana and Mary approved, my reverenced. Diana and Mary loved Moor House. my, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with Moor House's low roof, Moor House's latticed casements, Moor House's mouldering walls, Moor House's avenue of aged firs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; Moor House's garden, dark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest species w ould bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around They's dwelling—to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from They's gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both the feeling's strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of the locality's loneliness: I's eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag. These details were just to I what These details were to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the soft breeze;  the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round me's faculties the same spell that entranced them.  Indoors we agreed equally well. them were both more accomplished and better read than me was; but with eagerness me followed in the path of knowledge them had trodden before me. me devoured the books them lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what me had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.  If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, a superior and a leader was Diana. Physically, Diana far excelled me: Diana was handsome; Diana was vigorous. In Diana's animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited me's wonder, while it baffled me's comprehension. me could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone, me was  fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s feet, to rest my head on Diana’s's knee, and listen alternately to Diana’s and Mary, while her and Mary sounded thoroughly the topic on which my had but touched. Diana’s offered to teach my German. my liked to learn of Diana’s: my saw the part of instructress pleased and suited Diana’s; that of scholar pleased and suited my no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection—of the strongest kind—was the result. her and Mary discovered my could draw: her and Mary's pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my's service. my's skill, greater in this one point than her and Mary, surprised and charmed her and Mary. Mary would sit and watch my by the hour together: then Mary would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil Mary made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.  As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly between my and Mr. St John's sisters did not extend to Mr. St John. One reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that Mr. St John was c omparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his's parish.  No weather seemed to hinder his in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, his would, when his's hours of morning study were over, take his's hat, and, followed by his's father’s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his's mission of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light his regarded his mission of love or duty. Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his's sisters would expostulate. his would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful—  “And if his let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn his aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future his propose to his?”  Diana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.  But besides his's frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with his: his seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a br ooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his's life and habits, his yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening, when his sat at the window, his's desk and papers before his, his would cease reading or writing, rest his's chin on his's hand, and deliver his up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his's eye.  I think, moreover, that Nature was not to his that treasury of delight Nature was to his's sisters. his expressed once, and but once in I's hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls his called his's home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did his seem to roam the moors for the sake of the moors's soothing  silence—never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.  Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of gauging he's mind. I first got an idea of his mind's calibre when I heard he preach in he's own church at Morton. I wish I could describe preach: but describe is past I's power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect preach produced on I.  preach began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, preach was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language. an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of he: neither were softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each reference to Calvinistic doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation sounded like a sentence pron ounced for doom. When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by he's discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to I—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure he—pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found that peace of God which passeth all understanding, I thought, than had I with I's concealed and racking regrets for I's broken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which possessed I and tyrannised over I ruthlessly.  Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited Diana and Mary, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situ ation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble dependents, and who neither knew nor sought out they's innate excellences, and appreciated only they's acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of they's cook or the taste of they's waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about the employment Mr. St. John had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent that me should have a vocation of some kind. One morning, being left alone with Mr. St. John a few minutes in the parlour, me ventured to approach the window-recess—which Mr. St. John's table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study—and me was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame me's inquiry—for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as Mr. St. John's—when Mr. St. John saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.  Looking up as me drew near—“You have a question to ask of Mr. St. John?” Mr. St. John said.  “Yes; me wish to know whether Mr. St. John have hea rd of any service I can offer I to undertake?”  “I found or devised something for I three weeks ago; but as I seemed both useful and happy here—as I's sisters had evidently become attached to I, and I's society gave my sisters unusual pleasure—I deemed it inexpedient to break in on I's mutual comfort till my sisters's approaching departure from Marsh End should render I necessary.”  “And my sisters will go in three days now?” I said.  “Yes; and when my sisters go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will accompany I; and this old house will be shut up.”  I waited a few moments, expecting I would go on with the subject first broached: but I seemed to have entered another train of reflection: I's look denoted abstraction from I and I's business. I was obliged to recall I to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to I.  “What is the employment I had in view, I? I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing the employment you had in view.”  “Oh, n o; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept.”  me again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. you grew impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on me's face, conveyed the feeling to me as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.  “you need be in no hurry to hear,” me said: “let me frankly tell you, me have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before me explain, recall, if you please, me's notice, clearly given, that if me helped you, helped must be as the blind man would help the lame. me am poor; for me find that, when me have paid me's father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front. me am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependent’s crust among strangers, and the third considers the third an ali en from his native country—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, his honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his's shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members his is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he is one!’”  St. John said these words as St. John pronounced St. John's sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance. St. John resumed—  “And since St. John am St. John poor and obscure, St. John can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity. _you_ may even think a service of poverty and obscurity degrading—for St. John see now you's habits have been what the world calls refined: you's tastes lean to the ideal, and you's society has at least been amongst the educated; but _St. John_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race. St. John hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer’s task of tillage is appointed the Christian labourer’s—the scantier the  meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. his's, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles—the first pioneers of the Gospel's captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.”  “Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”  he looked at I before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read I's face, as if my face's features and lines were characters on a page. The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in he's succeeding observations.  “he believe I will accept the post he offer I,” said he, “and hold the post I offer you for a while: not permanently, though: any more than he could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in I's nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in he, though of a different kind.”  “Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.  “he will; and I shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how cramping. he shall not stay long at Morton, now that  my father is dead, and that my am my's own master. my shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while my do stay, my will exert my to the utmost for the place's improvement. the place, when my came to the place two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress. my established one for boys: my mean now to open a second school for girls. my have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house for the mistress’s house. the mistress’s's salary will be thirty pounds a year: the mistress’s house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my's parish—Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. a lady, Miss Oliver pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that a lady, Miss Oliver shall aid the mistress’s in such menial offices connected with the mistress’s house and a second school for girls as the mistress’s's occupation of teaching w ill prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will you be her?”  He put the question rather hurriedly; He seemed half to expect an indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing all you's thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, He could not tell in what light the lot would appear to you. In truth the lot was humble—but then the lot was sheltered, and you wanted a safe asylum: the lot was plodding—but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, the lot was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered you's soul like iron: it was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, you made you's decision.  “you thank He for the proposal, He, and you accept the proposal with all you's heart.”  “But you comprehend He?” He said. “It is a village school: you's scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children—at the best, farmers’ daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to teach. What will you do with you's accomplis hments? What, with the largest portion of your mind—sentiments—tastes?”  “Save the largest portion of your mind—sentiments—tastes till the largest portion of your mind—sentiments—tastes are wanted. the largest portion of your mind—sentiments—tastes will keep.”  “your know what your undertake, then?”  “your do.”  your now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply gratified.  “And when will your commence the exercise of your's function?”  “your will go to your's house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week.”  “Very well: so be it.”  your rose and walked through the room. Standing still, your again looked at your. your shook your's head.  “What do your disapprove of, your?” your asked.  “your will not stay at Morton long: no, no!”  “Why? What is your's reason for saying so?”  “your read your reason for saying so in your's eye; your reason for saying so is not of that description which promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life.”  “your am not ambitious.”  your started at the word “ambitious.” your repeated, “No. What made your think of ambition? Who is ambitious? your know your am: but how did your find am out?”  “your was speaking of your.”  “Well, if your are not  ambitious, you are—” you paused.  “What?”  “you was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the word, and been displeased. you mean, that human affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. you am sure you cannot long be content to pass you's leisure in solitude, and to devote you's working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus: any more than you can be content,” you added, with emphasis, “to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—you's nature, that God gave you, contravened; you's faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made useless. you hear now how you contradict you. youGod's —youGod's , almost rave in you's restlessness. Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means.”  you left the room. In this brief hour you had learnt more of you than in the whole previous month: yet still you p uzzled me.  Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving Diana and Mary Rivers's brother and Diana and Mary Rivers's home. Diana and Mary Rivers tried to appear as usual; but the sorrow Diana and Mary Rivers had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any Diana and Mary Rivers had ever yet known. this would probably, as far as their brother was concerned, be a parting for years: this might be a parting for life.  “their brother will sacrifice all to their brother's long-framed resolves,” Diana said: “natural affection and feelings more potent still. their brother looks quiet, Jane; but their brother hides a fever in their brother's vitals. Jane would think their brother gentle, yet in some things their brother is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, Diana's conscience will hardly permit Diana to dissuade their brother from their brother's severe decision: certainly, Diana cannot for a moment blame their brother for his severe decision. It is right, noble, Christian: yet It breaks Diana's heart!” And the tears gushed to Diana's fine eyes. Mary Rivers bent Mary Rivers's head low over Mary Rivers's work.   “We are now without father: We shall soon be without home and brother,” she murmured.  At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that “misfortunes never come singly,” and to add to We's distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a letter. St. John entered.  “Our uncle John is dead,” said St. John.  We seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; is appeared in We's eyes rather momentous than afflicting.  “Dead?” repeated she.  “Yes.”  she riveted a searching gaze on she's face. “And what then?” she demanded, in a low voice.  “What then, Die?” St. John replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature. “What then? Why—nothing. Read.”  St. John threw a letter into she's lap. she glanced over a letter, and handed a letter to Mary. Mary perused a letter in silence, and returned a letter to Mary's . All three looked at each other, and All three smiled—a dreary, pensive  smile enough.  “Amen! We can yet live,” said Diana at last.  “At any rate, it makes We no worse off than We were before,” remarked Mary.  “Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might have been_,” said Mr. Rivers, “and contrasts the picture of what _might have been_ somewhat too vividly with what _is_.”  Mr. Rivers folded the letter, locked the letter in Mr. Rivers's desk, and again went out.  For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.  “me, me will wonder at us and us's mysteries,” Diana said, “and think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as an uncle; but us have never seen so near a relation as an uncle or known so near a relation as an uncle. so near a relation as an uncle was me's mother’s brother. me's father and so near a relation as an uncle quarrelled long ago. It was by so near a relation as an uncle's advice that My father risked most of My father's property in the speculation that ruined My father. Mutual recrimination passed between My father and he: My father and he parted in anger, and were never reconciled. so near a relation as an uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears so near a relation as an uncle realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than ourselves. My father always cherished the idea that My father would atone for My father's error by leaving My father's possessions to ourselves; that letter informs ourselves that My father has bequeathed every penny to one other person, not more closely related than we, with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between He, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings. My father had a right, of course, to do as My father pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news. Mary Rivers My would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to He such a sum would have been valuable, for the good such a sum would have enabled He to do.”  This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made to the subject by either He or He's sisters. The next day My left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana Mary Rivers quitted Marsh End for distant B——. In a week, He and Hannah repair ed to the parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.     CHAPTER XXXI   My home, then, when My at last find a home,—is a cottage; a little room with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled with My's scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of My's gentle and generous friends has increased my scanty wardrobe, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.  It is evening. My have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan who serves My as a handmaid. My am sitting alone on the hearth. This morning, the village school opened. My had twenty scholars. But three of twenty scholars can read: none write or cipher. Several knit, and a few sew a little. They speak with the broadest accent of the district. At present, They and My have a difficul ty in understanding each other’s language. Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a disposition that pleases me. me must not forget that them are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in them's hearts as in those of the best-born. me's duty will be to develop the germs of native excellence, refinement, intelligence, kind feeling: surely me shall find some happiness in discharging My duty. Much enjoyment me do not expect in the life opening before me: yet the life opening before me will, doubtless, if me regulate me's mind, and exert me's powers as me ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.  Was me very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours me passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to deceive me, me must reply—No: me felt desolate to a degree. me felt—yes, idiot that me am—me felt degr aded. I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising I in the scale of social existence. I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I heard and saw round I. But let I not hate and despise I too much for these feelings; I know these feelings to be wrong—that is a great step gained; I shall strive to overcome these feelings. To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the better of these feelings partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, these feelings will be quite subdued. In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing progress, and a change for the better in I's scholars may substitute gratification for disgust.  Meantime, let I ask I one question—Which is better?—To have surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort—no struggle;—but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering the silken snare; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr. Rochester’s mistress; deli rious with his love half my time—for his would—oh, yes, his would have loved my well for a while. his _did_ love my—no one will ever love my so again. my shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else shall my seem to possess beauty, youth, and grace. his was fond and proud of my—it is what no man besides will ever be.—But where am my wandering, and what am my saying, and above all, feeling? Whether is it better, my ask, to be a slave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles—fevered with delusive bliss one hour—suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next—or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?  Yes; my feel now that my was right when my adhered to principle and law, and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God directed my to a correct choice: my thank God for the guidance!  Having brought my's eventide musings to this point, my rose, went  to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my's cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village. The birds were singing The birds's last strains—  “The air was mild, the dew was balm.”   While my looked, my thought my happy, and was surprised to find my ere long weeping—and why? For the doom which had reft my from adhesion to my's master: for my master my was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury—consequences of my's departure—which might now, perhaps, be dragging my master from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, my turned my's face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—my say _lonely_, for in that bend of Morton visible to my there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and the rich Mr. Oliver's daughter lived. my hid my's eyes, and leant my face agains t the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my's tiny garden from the meadow beyond the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made my look up. A dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as my saw in a moment—was pushing the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it with A dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as I saw in a moment—'s nose, and St. John St. John himself leant upon the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it with folded arms; St. John himself's brow knit, St. John himself's gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on my. my asked St. John himself to come in.  “No, St. John himself cannot stay; St. John himself have only brought my a little parcel St. John himself's sisters left for my. St. John himself think a little parcel my sisters left for you contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.”  my approached to take a little parcel my sisters left for you: a welcome gift a little parcel my sisters left for you was. St. John himself examined my's face, my thought, with austerity, as my came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon my face.  “Have my found my's first day’s work harder than my expected?” St. John himself asked.  “Oh, no! On the contrary, my think in time my shall get on with my's scholars very well.”  “But perhaps my's accommodations—my's cottage—my's furniture—have disappointed my's expectations? your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture are, in truth, scanty enough; but—” my int errupted—  “My cottage is clean and weather-proof; My's furniture sufficient and commodious. All My see has made My thankful, not despondent. My am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago My had nothing—My was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now My have acquaintance, a home, a business. My wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of My's friends; the bounty of My's lot. My do not repine.”  “But My feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind My is dark and empty.”  “My have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness.”  “Very well; I hope My feel the content My express: at any rate, My's good sense will tell My that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of Lot’s wife. What My had left before I saw My, of course I do not know; but I counsel My to resist firmly every temptation which would incline My to look  back: pursue pursue's present career steadily, for some months at least.”  “pursue is what pursue mean to do,” pursue answered. St. John continued—  “It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, St. John know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make us's own fate; and when us's energies seem to demand a sustenance our energies cannot get—when us's will strains after a path us may not follow—us need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: us have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food the mind longed to taste—and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than the one Fortune has blocked up against us.  “A year ago pursue was pursue intensely miserable, because pursue thought pursue had made a mistake in entering the ministry: the ministry's uniform duties wearied pursue to death. pursue burnt for the more active life of the world—for the more exciting toils of  a literary career—for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate’s surplice. my considered; my's life was so wretched, my life must be changed, or my must die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my's cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds—my's powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather my powers's full strength, spread my powers's wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an errand for my; to bear which afar, to deliver an errand for me well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator centre in the good missionary.  “A missionary my resolved to be. From that moment my's state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time o nly can heal. My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since My father's death, My have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a successor for My father provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with human weakness, in which My know My shall overcome, because My have vowed that My _will_ overcome—and My leave Europe for the East.”  My said this, in My's peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when My had ceased speaking, not at My, but at the setting sun, at which My looked too. Both My and My had Both he and I's backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket. Both he and I had heard no step on the path leading up the field to the wicket; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; Both he and I might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed—  “Good evening, My. And good evening, My. My's dog is quicker to recognise Your dog's friends than My are, My; Your dog pricked Your dog's ears and wagged h is tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have you's back towards I now.”  It was true. Though you had started at the first of those musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over you's head, you stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which I had surprised you—you's arm resting on the gate, you's face directed towards the west. you turned at last, with measured deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at you's side. There appeared, within three feet of you, a form clad in pure white—a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up it's head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under you's glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but me do not retrace or qualify Perfect beauty: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever Albion's humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, j ustified, in this instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully the young girl. I wondered, as I looked at the young girl: I admired the young girl with I's whole heart. Nature had surely formed the young girl in a partial mood; and, forgetting the young girl's usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, the young girl's darling, with a grand-dame’s bounty.  What did I  Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked I that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in him's countenance. him had already withdrawn him's eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.  “A lovely evening, but late for her to be out alone,” him said, as him crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with him's foot.  “Oh, her only came home from S——” (her mentioned the name of a large town some twenty miles distant) “this afternoon. Papa told her you had opened you's school, and that the new mistress was come; and so her put on her's bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see the new mistress: this is the new mistress?” pointing to I.  “this is,” said I.  “Do I think I shall like Morton?” her asked of I, with a direct and naïve simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.  “I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.”  “Did I find I's scholars as attentive as I e xpected?”  “Quite.”  “Do you like you's house?”  “Very much.”  “Have you furnished your house nicely?”  “Very nicely, indeed.”  “And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?”  “you have indeed. an attendant is teachable and handy.” (This then, you thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of the planets presided over Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature's birth, you wonder?)  “I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,” I added. “It will be a change for I to visit you now and then; and I like a change. you, I have been _so_ gay during I's stay at S——. Last night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock. The ——th regiment are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: the officers put all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.”  It seemed to I that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and Mr. St. John’s's upper lip curled a moment. Mr. St. John’s's mouth certainly looked a  good deal compressed, and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave his this information. his lifted his's gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned his gaze on the laughing girl. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was. the laughing girl answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well became the laughing girl's youth, the laughing girl's roses, the laughing girl's dimples, the laughing girl's bright eyes.  As his stood, mute and grave, the laughing girl again fell to caressing Carlo. “Carlo loves the laughing girl,” said the laughing girl. “_Carlo_ is not stern and distant to Carlo's friends; and if Carlo could speak, Carlo would not be silent.”  As the laughing girl patted Carlo's head, bending with native grace before Carlo's , I saw a glow rise to his's face. I saw his's solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion. Flushed and kindled thus, his looked nearly as beautiful for a man as the laughing girl for a woman. his's chest heaved once, as if his's large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the att ainment of liberty. But he curbed liberty, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. he responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made he.  “Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Papa, looking up. “you are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. Papa is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with Papa and visit Papa?”  “It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Papa,” answered you.  “Not a seasonable hour! But you declare It is. It is just the hour when Papa most wants company: when the works are closed and Papa has no business to occupy Papa. Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come. Why are Mr. Rivers so very shy, and so very sombre?” She filled up the hiatus Mr. Rivers's silence left by a reply of She's own.  “She forgot!” She exclaimed, shaking She's beautiful curled head, as if shocked at She. “She am so giddy and thoughtless! _Do_ excuse She. It had slipped She's memory that Mr. Rivers have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in She's chatter. Diana and Mary have  left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see papa.”  “Not to-night, I, not to-night.”  you spoke almost like an automaton: you only knew the effort it cost you thus to refuse.  “Well, if you are so obstinate, you will leave I; for you dare not stay any longer: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!”  I held out I's hand. you just touched her hand. “Good evening!” you repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo. I turned, but in a moment returned.  “Are you well?” I asked. Well might I put the question: you's face was blanched as I's gown.  “Quite well,” you enunciated; and, with a bow, you left the gate. I went one way; you another. I turned twice to gaze after you as I tripped fairy-like down the field; you, as you strode firmly across, never turned at all.  This spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my's own. Diana Rivers had designated Diana Rivers's brother “inexo rable as death.” She had not exaggerated.     CHAPTER XXXII   I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I could. continued was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, with all I's efforts, I could comprehend I's scholars and my scholars's nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, my scholars seemed to I hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst my scholars as amongst the educated; and when I got to know my scholars, and II, a difference amongst them as amongst the educated rapidly developed a difference amongst them as amongst the educated. my scholars's amazement at I, I's language, I's rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of my scholars wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed Many obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst my scholars not a few examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won both I's goodwill and I's admiration. my scholars soon took a pleasure in doing the ir work well, in keeping ir's persons neat, in learning ir's tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The rapidity of ir's progress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and happy pride ir took in their progress: besides, ir began personally to like some of the best girls; and some of the best girls liked ir. ir had amongst ir's scholars several farmers’ daughters: young women grown, almost. several farmers’ daughters: young women grown, almost could already read, write, and sew; and to several farmers’ daughters: young women grown, almost ir taught the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of needlework. ir found estimable characters amongst several farmers’ daughters: young women grown, almost—characters desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom ir passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. their's parents then (the farmer and the farmer's wife) loaded ir with attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting Their parents's simple kindness, and in repaying their simple kindness by a consideration—a scrupulous regard to Their parents's feelings—to which Their parents were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which Their parents charmed  and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in them's own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment them received.  I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;” serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this period of I's life, I's heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful existence—after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst I's scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone—I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I  still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of being in Mr. Rochester's arms, hearing Mr. Rochester's voice, meeting Mr. Rochester's eye, touching Mr. Rochester's hand and cheek, loving Mr. Rochester, being loved by Mr. Rochester—the hope of passing a lifetime at Mr. Rochester's side, would be renewed, with all the hope of passing a lifetime at his side's first force and fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then I rose up on I's curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the burst of passion. By nine o’clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.  Rosamond Oliver kept Rosamond Oliver's word in coming to visit I. Rosamond Oliver's call at the school was generally made in the course of Rosamond Oliver's morning ride. Rosamond Oliver would canter up to the door on Rosamond Oliver's pony, followed by a mounted livery servant. Anything more exquisite than Rosamond Oliver's appearance, in Rosamond Oliver's purple habit, with Rosamond Oliver's Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully  above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her's shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus her would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children. her generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving Mr. Rivers's daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of her pierce Mr. Rivers's heart. A sort of instinct seemed to warn Mr. Rivers of her's entrance, even when Mr. Rivers did not see her entrance; and when Mr. Rivers was looking quite away from the door, if her appeared at the door, Mr. Rivers's cheek would glow, and Mr. Rivers's marble-seeming features, though his marble-seeming features refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in his marble-seeming features's very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.  Of course, her knew her's power: indeed, Mr. Rivers did not, because Mr. Rivers could not, conceal her power from her. In spite of Mr. Rivers's Christian stoicism, when her went up and addressed Mr. Rivers, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly  in his face, his's hand would tremble and his's eye burn. his seemed to say, with his's sad and resolute look, if his did not say it with his's lips, “his love you, and his know you prefer his. It is not despair of success that keeps his dumb. If his offered his's heart, his believe you would accept my heart. But my heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round my heart. my heart will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”  And then you would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften you's radiant vivacity; you would withdraw his hand hastily from his's, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like. his, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain you, when you thus left his; but his would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of you's love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, his could not bind all that his had in his's nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest—in the limits  of a single passion. He could not—He would not—renounce He's wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from He in an inroad I once, despite He's reserve, had the daring to make on He's confidence.  Miss Oliver already honoured I with frequent visits to I's cottage. I had learnt Miss Oliver's whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: Miss Oliver was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish. Miss Oliver had been indulged from Miss Oliver's birth, but was not absolutely spoilt. Miss Oliver was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (Miss Oliver could not help vain, when every glance in the glass showed Miss Oliver such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: Miss Oliver was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of Miss Oliver's own sex like I; but Miss Oliver was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was Miss Oliver from that,  for instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I liked I's pupil Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.  her had taken an amiable caprice to I. her said I was like Mr. Rivers, only, certainly, her allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but Mr. Rivers was an angel.” I was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like Mr. Rivers. I was a _lusus naturæ_, her affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: her was sure I's previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance.  One evening, while, with her's usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, her was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer of I's little kitchen, her discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then I's drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head  of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors. a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.  “Had my done these pictures? Did my know French and German? What a love—what a miracle my was! my drew better than a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars's master in the first school in S——. Would my sketch a portrait of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, to show to papa?”  “With pleasure,” my replied; and my felt a thrill of artist-delight at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars had then on a dark-blue silk dress; a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars's arms and a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars's neck were bare; a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars's only ornament was a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars's chestnut tresses, which waved over a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars's shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls. my took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline. my promised my the pleasure of colouring a careful outline; and, as it was getting late then, my told a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars must come and sit another day.  a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars made such a report of my to papa, that Mr. Oliver Mr. Oliver himself  accompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at whose side her looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret. his appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but his was very kind to me. The sketch of her's portrait pleased his highly: his said me must make a finished picture of Rosamond’s portrait. his insisted, too, on me's coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale Hall.  me went. me found Vale Hall a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evidences of wealth in the proprietor. her was full of glee and pleasure all the time me stayed. his was affable; and when his entered into conversation with me after tea, his expressed in strong terms his's approbation of what me had done in Morton school, and said his only feared, from what his saw and heard, me was too good for Vale Hall, and would soon quit Vale Hall for one more suitable.  “Indeed,” cried her, “me is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, his.”  me thought me w ould far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with great respect. Mr. Oliver said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the Rivers family were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to the Rivers family; that even now Mr. Oliver considered the representative of the Rivers family might, if the representative of that house liked, make an alliance with the best. Mr. Oliver accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away. It appeared, then, that so fine and talented a young man's father would throw no obstacle in the way of so fine and talented a young man's union with St. John. Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the representative of that house's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.  It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. I's little servant, after helping I to clean I's house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a penny for My little servant's aid. All about I was spotless  and bright—scoured floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made I neat, and had now the afternoon before I to spend as I would.  The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got I's palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature. The head was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, I's door unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.  “St. John Rivers am come to see how I are spending I's holiday,” St. John Rivers said. “Not, St. John Rivers hope, in thought? No, that is well: while I draw I will not feel lonely. I see, St. John Rivers mistrust I still, though I have borne up wonderfully so far. St. John Rivers have brought I a book for evening solace, ” and he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days—the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of our era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert they's existence, they's presence, they's liberty and strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in heaven! Powerful angels, safe in heaven! smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over feeble ones's destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without they's divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell of your own meanness.  While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of “Marmion” (for “Marmion” it was), he stooped to examine I's drawing. he's tall figure spran g erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at he: he shunned I's eye. I knew he's thoughts well, and could read he's heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then temporarily the advantage of he, and I conceived an inclination to do he some good, if I could.  “With all he's firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks he too far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit he to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make he talk.”  I said first, “Take a chair, he.” But he answered, as he always did, that he could not stay. “Very well,” I responded, mentally, “stand if he like; but he shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for he as solitude is for I. I’ll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of he's confidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of  the balm of sympathy.”  “Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly.  “Like! Like whom? I did not observe this portrait closely.”  “I did, I.”  I almost started at I's sudden and strange abruptness: I looked at I astonished. “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within. “I don’t mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on I's part; I’m prepared to go to considerable lengths.” I continued, “I observed this portrait closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to I's looking at this portrait again,” and I rose and placed this portrait in I's hand.  “this portrait,” I said; “very soft, clear colouring; very graceful and correct drawing.”  “Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it like?”  Mastering some hesitation, I answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.”  “Of course. And now, I, to reward I for the accurate guess, I will promise to paint I a careful and faithful duplicate of this portrait, provided I admit that the gift would be acceptable to I. I don’t wish to throw  away my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless.”  He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer He looked, the firmer He held the picture, the more He seemed to covet the picture. “It is like!” He murmured; “the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!”  “Would it comfort, or would it wound He to have a similar painting? Tell ” that. When He are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a consolation to have the picture in He's possession? or would the sight of the picture bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?”  He now furtively raised He's eyes: He glanced at ”, irresolute, disturbed: He again surveyed the picture.  “That He should like to have the picture is certain: whether it would be judicious or wise is another question.”  Since ” had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred He, and that Rosamond's father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in ”'s views than He—had been strongly disposed in ”'s own heart to adv ocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with Mr. Oliver’s large fortune as if he went and laid he's genius out to wither, and he's strength to waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion me now answered—  “As far as me can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if he were to take to he the original at once.”  By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before he, and with he's brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over the picture. me discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at me's audacity. me saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed unapproachable—to hear a subject he had deemed unapproachable thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt by he as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of Reserved people's sentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the sil ent sea” of their souls is often to confer on their the first of obligations.  “She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind you's chair, “and She's father respects you. Moreover, She is a sweet girl—rather thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both you and She. you ought to marry She.”  “_Does_ She like you?” you asked.  “Certainly; better than She likes any one else. She talks of you continually: there is no subject She enjoys so much or touches upon so often.”  “It is very pleasant to hear this,” you said—“very: go on for another quarter of an hour.” And you actually took out you's watch and laid his watch upon the table to measure the time.  “But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter you's heart?”  “Don’t imagine such hard things. Fancy you yielding and melting, as you am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in you's mind and overflowing with sweet inundati on all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans. And now all the field is deluged with a nectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering the young germs: now I see I stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at I's bride Rosamond Oliver’s feet: my bride Rosamond Oliver’s is talking to I with my bride Rosamond Oliver’s's sweet voice—gazing down on I with those eyes your skilful hand has copied so well—smiling at I with these coral lips. my bride Rosamond Oliver’s is mine—I am my bride Rosamond Oliver’s—this present life and passing world suffice to I. Hush! say nothing—I's heart is full of delight—I's senses are entranced—let the time I marked pass in peace.”  I humoured your: the watch ticked on: your breathed fast and low: I stood silent. Amidst this hush the quartet sped; your replaced the watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.  “Now,” said your, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion. your rested your's temples on the breast of temptation,  and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers; my tasted her's cup. The pillow was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her's promises are hollow—her's offers false: my see and know all this.”  I gazed at my in wonder.  “It is strange,” pursued my, “that while my love her so wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—my experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that her would not make my a good wife; that her is not the partner suited to my; that my should discover is within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’ rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This my know.”  “Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating.  “While something in my,” my went on, “is acutely sensible to her's charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her's defects: her defects are such that her could sympathise in nothing my aspired to—co-operate in nothing  I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle? Rosamond a missionary’s wife? No!”  “But I need not be a missionary. I might relinquish that scheme.”  “Relinquish! What! I's vocation? I's great work? I's foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven? I's hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting peace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? that is dearer than the blood in I's veins. that is what I have to look forward to, and to live for.”  After a considerable pause, I said—“And Miss Oliver? Are Miss Oliver's disappointment and sorrow of no interest to I?”  “Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a month, I's image will be effaced from Miss Oliver's heart. Miss Oliver will forget I; and will marry, probably, some one who will make Miss Oliver far happier than I  should do.”  “You speak coolly enough; but You suffer in the conflict. You are wasting away.”  “No. If You get a little thin, get is with anxiety about You's prospects, yet unsettled—You's departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning, You received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival You have been so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace You for three months to come yet; and perhaps three months may extend to six.”  “You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom.”  Again the surprised expression crossed You's face. You had not imagined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For You, You felt at home in this sort of discourse. You could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till You had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female's heart’s very hearthstone.  “You _are_ original,” said You, “and not timid. There is something bra ve in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your's eye; but allow me to assure your that your partially misinterpret me's emotions. your think my emotions more profound and potent than my emotions are. your give me a larger allowance of sympathy than me have a just claim to. When me colour, and when me shake before Miss Oliver, me do not pity me. me scorn the weakness. me know the weakness is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, me declare, the convulsion of the soul. _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what me am—a cold hard man.”  I smiled incredulously.  “I have taken me's confidence by storm,” me continued, “and now my confidence is much at I's service. me am simply, in me's original state—stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity—me. Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling, is me's guide; me's ambition is unlimited: me's desire to rise higher, to do m ore than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, talent; because endurance, perseverance, industry, talent are the means by which men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with interest, because I consider your a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what your have gone through, or what your still suffer.”  “I would describe I as a mere pagan philosopher,” your said.  “No. There is this difference between I and deistic philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel. your missed your's epithet. I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus. As Jesus's disciple I adopt Jesus's pure, Jesus's merciful, Jesus's benignant doctrines. I advocate His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines: I am sworn to spread His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated I's original qualities thus:—From the minute germ, natural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a  due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power and renown for my wretched self, my wretched self has formed the ambition to spread my's Master’s kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross. So much has religion done for my; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning and training nature. But my wretched self could not eradicate nature: nor will nature be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put on immortality.’”  Having said this, my took my's hat, which lay on the table beside my's palette. Once more my looked at the portrait.  “She _is_ lovely,” my murmured. “She is well named the Rose of the World, indeed!”  “And may my not paint one like the portrait for my?”  “_Cui bono_? No.”  my drew over the portrait the sheet of thin paper on which my was accustomed to rest my's hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What my suddenly saw on the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied, it was impossible for my to tell; but something had caught my's eye. my took the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied up with a snatch; my looked at the edg e; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in me's shape, face, and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted, as if to speak: but His checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.  “What is the matter?” me asked.  “Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and, replacing the paper, me saw His dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. a narrow slip disappeared in His's glove; and, with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon,” His vanished.  “Well!” me exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps the globe, however!”  me, in me's turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on the paper save a few dingy stains of paint where me had tried the tint in me's pencil. me pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding the mystery insolvable, and being certain the mystery could not be of much moment, me dismissed, and soon forgot the mystery.     CHAPTER XXXIII   When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the wh irling storm continued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable. I had closed I's shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under the door, trimmed I's fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and beginning—  “Day set on Norham’s castled steep, And Tweed’s fair river broad and deep,     And Cheviot’s mountains lone; The massive towers, the donjon keep, The flanking walls that round The massive towers sweep,     In yellow lustre shone”—   I soon forgot storm in music.  I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St. John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before I: the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale t hat night.  “Any ill news?” I demanded. “Has anything happened?”  “No. How very easily alarmed I are!” he answered, removing he's cloak and hanging his cloak up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which he's entrance had deranged. he stamped the snow from he's boots.  “he shall sully the purity of I's floor,” said he, “but I must excuse he for once.” Then he approached the fire. “he have had hard work to get here, he assure I,” he observed, as he warmed he's hands over the fire. “One drift took he up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet.”  “But why are he come?” I could not forbear saying.  “Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since I ask it, he answer simply to have a little talk with I; he got tired of he's mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday he have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel.”  he sat down. I recalled he's singular conduct of y esterday, and really I began to fear his wits were touched. If his were insane, however, his's was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his's look more like chiselled marble than that handsome-featured face of his did just now, as his put aside his's snow-wet hair from his's forehead and let the firelight shine free on his's pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved I to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting his would say something I could at least comprehend; but his's hand was now at his's chin, his's finger on his's lip: his was thinking. It struck I that his hand looked wasted like that handsome-featured face of his. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over I's heart: I was moved to say—  “I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with his: it is too bad that his should be quite alone; and his are recklessly rash about his's own health.”  “Not at all,” said his: “his care for his when necessary. his am well now. What do I see amiss in his?”  This was said wit h a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. my was silenced.  his still slowly moved his's finger over his's upper lip, and still his's eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something, my asked his presently if his felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind his.  “No, no!” his responded shortly and somewhat testily.  “Well,” my reflected, “if his won’t talk, his may be still; my’ll let his alone now, and return to my's book.”  So my snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of “Marmion.” his soon stirred; my's eye was instantly drawn to his's movements; his only took out a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which his read in silence, folded a letter, which he read in silence, put a letter, which he read in silence back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain to try to read with his; nor could my, in impatience, consent to be dumb; his might rebuff my if his liked, but talk my would.  “Have his heard from Diana and  Mary lately?”  “Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.”  “There has not been any change made about you's own arrangements? you will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?”  “you fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall you.” Baffled so far, you changed you's ground. you bethought you to talk about the school and you's scholars.  “Mary's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this morning, and you shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close—four new girls would have come to-day but for the snow.”  “Indeed!”  “Mr. Oliver pays for two.”  “Does Mr. Oliver?”  “Mr. Oliver means to give the school a treat at Christmas.”  “you know.”  “Was it you's suggestion?”  “No.”  “Whose, then?”  “Mr. Oliver's , you think.”  “It is like Mary: Mary is so good-natured.”  “Yes.”  Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. struck aroused you; you uncrossed you's legs, sat erect, turned to you.  “Leave you's book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,” you sa id.  Wondering, and of i's wonder finding no end, i complied.  “Half-an-hour ago,” he pursued, “he spoke of he's impatience to hear the sequel of a tale: on reflection, he find the matter will be better managed by he's assuming the narrator’s part, and converting i into a listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn i that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when stale details pass through new lips. For the rest, whether trite or novel, the rest, whether trite or novel is short.  “Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment's name at this moment—fell in love with a rich man’s daughter; a rich man’s daughter fell in love with a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment, and married a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment, against the advice of all a rich man’s daughter's friends, who consequently disowned a rich man’s daughter immediately after the wedding. Before two years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab. (i have seen the rash pair's grave; one slab formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral  of an overgrown manufacturing town in ——shire.) They left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in Charity's lap—cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried its to the house of its's rich maternal relations; its was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You start—did You hear a noise? I daresay a noise is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.—To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept its ten years: whether its was happy or not with Mrs. Reed, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of ten years Mrs. Reed transferred its to a place You know—being no other than Lowood School, where You so long resided You. It seems Mrs. Reed's career there was very honourable: from a pupil, Mrs. Reed became a teacher, like You—really it strikes I there are parallel points in Mrs. Reed's history and You—sh e left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous; a governess undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester.”  “Mr. Rivers!” I interrupted.  “Mr. Rivers can guess I's feelings,” Mr. Rivers said, “but restrain your feelings for a while: Mr. Rivers have nearly finished; hear Mr. Rivers to the end. Of a certain Mr. Rochester's character Mr. Rivers know nothing, but the one fact that a certain Mr. Rochester professed to offer honourable marriage to a governess, and that at the very altar a governess discovered a certain Mr. Rochester had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic. What a certain Mr. Rochester's subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after a governess necessary, it was discovered a governess was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how. a governess had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after a governess's course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting a governess. Yet that a governess should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertise ments have been put in all the papers; I I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I myself have just imparted. Is it not an odd tale?”  “Just tell I myself this,” said I myself, “and since I myself know so much, I myself surely _can_ tell this I myself—what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is Mr. Rochester? What is Mr. Rochester doing? Is Mr. Rochester well?”  “I myself am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: a letter never mentions Mr. Rochester but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I myself have adverted to. I myself should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature of the event which requires the governess's appearance.”  “Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”  “I myself suppose not.”  “But they wrote to Mr. Rochester?”  “Of course.”  “And what did Mr. Rochester say? Who has Mr. Rochester's letters?”  “one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted intimates that the answer to Mr. Rochester's application was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: the answer to his application is signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”  I myself felt cold and dismayed: I myself's worst fears then were probably true: Mr. Rochester had in all probability left  England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe sufferings—what object for his's strong passions—had his sought there? I dared not answer the question. Oh, I's I's I I's !”  “his must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers.  “Mr. Rivers don’t know his—don’t pronounce an opinion upon his,” I said, with warmth.  “Very well,” Mr. Rivers answered quietly: “and indeed Mr. Rivers's head is otherwise occupied than with his: Mr. Rivers have Mr. Rivers's tale to finish. Since I won’t ask the governess’s name, Mr. Rivers must tell my tale to finish of Mr. Rivers's own accord. Stay! Mr. Rivers have my tale to finish here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.”  And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through; from one of the pocket-book's compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off's texture and a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off's stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion,  the ravished margin of the portrait-cover. He got up, held the portrait-cover close to my eyes: and my read, traced in Indian ink, in my's own handwriting, the words “JANE EYRE”—the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.  “Briggs wrote to my of a Jane Eyre:” Briggs said, “the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre: Briggs knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess Briggs had Briggs's suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon my suspicions were at once resolved into certainty. my own the name and renounce the _alias_?”  “Yes—yes; but where is Briggs? Briggs perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than my do.”  “Briggs is in London. Briggs should doubt Briggs's knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester Briggs is interested. Meantime, my forget essential points in pursuing trifles: my do not inquire why Briggs sought after my—what Briggs wanted with my.”  “Well, what did Briggs want?”  “Merely to tell my that my's uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira has left my all your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira's property, and that my are now rich—merely  that—nothing more.”  “I!—rich?”  “Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.”  Silence succeeded.  “you must prove you's identity of course,” resumed St. John presently: “prove; you can then enter on immediate possession. you's fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents.”  Here was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_ is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about this: all this's associations are solid and sober, and this's manifestations are the same. One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourse lves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.  Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death, Funeral. My uncle My had heard was dead—My's only relative; ever since being made aware of My uncle I had heard's existence, My had cherished the hope of one day seeing My uncle I had heard: now, My never should. And then this money came only to My: not to My and a rejoicing family, but to My. this money was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, My felt that—_that_ thought swelled My's heart.  “My unbend My's forehead at last,” said Mr. Rivers. “Mr. Rivers thought Medusa had looked at My, and that My were turning to stone. Perhaps now My will ask how much My are worth?”  “How much am My worth?”  “Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, Mr. Rivers think they say—but what is twenty thousand pounds?”  “Twenty thousand pounds?”  Here was a new stunner—My had been calculating on four or five thousand. This news actually took My's breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom My had never hea rd laugh before, laughed now.  “Well,” said he, “if you had committed a murder, and he had told you you's crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.”  “It is a large sum—don’t he think there is a mistake?”  “No mistake at all.”  “Perhaps he have read the figures wrong—It may be two thousand!”  “It is written in letters, not figures,—twenty thousand.”  you again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred. he rose now and put he's cloak on.  “If it were not such a very wild night,” he said, “he would send Hannah down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone. But Hannah could not stride the drifts so well as he: Hannah's legs are not quite so long: so he must e’en leave you to you's sorrows. Good-night.”  he was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to you.  “Stop one minute!” you cried.  “Well?”  “It puzzles me to know why Mr. Br iggs wrote to you about me; or how iggs knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the power to aid in me's discovery.”  “Oh! you am a clergyman,” you said; “and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters.” Again the latch rattled.  “No; that does not satisfy you!” me exclaimed: and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allaying, piqued me's curiosity more than ever.  “It is a very strange piece of business,” me added; “me must know more about It.”  “Another time.”  “No; to-night!—to-night!” and as you turned from the door, me placed me between the door and you. you looked rather embarrassed.  “you certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” me said.  “you would rather not just now.”  “you shall!—you must!”  “you would rather Diana or Mary informed me.”  Of course these objections wrought me's eagerness to a climax: gratified it must be, and that without delay; and me told you so.  “But me apprised you that me was a ha rd man,” said he, “difficult to persuade.”  “And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off.”   And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off  “And then,” he pursued, “he am cold: no fervour infects he.”  “Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed all the snow from he's cloak; by the same token, The blaze there has streamed on to I's floor, and made my floor like a trampled street. As he hope ever to be forgiven, he, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell I what I wish to know.”  “Well, then,” he said, “he yield; if not to I's earnestness, to I's perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, I must know some day,—as well now as later. I's name is Jane Eyre?”  “Of course: that was all settled before.”  “he are not, perhaps, aware that I am he's namesake?—that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers?”  “No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in he's initials written in books he have at different times lent m e; but I never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely—”  I stopped: I could not trust I to entertain, much less to express, the thought that rushed upon I—that embodied itself,—that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit Circumstances, fitted Circumstances, shot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat St. John's explanation.  “I's mother’s name was Eyre; My mother’s had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being My mother’s's solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of us's death, and to say that My mother’s had left My mother’s's property to My mother’s's brother the clergyman’s orphan daug hter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father. him wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of the heiress. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find the heiress out. You know the rest.” Again me was going, but You set You's back against the door.  “Do let You speak,” You said; “let You have one moment to draw breath and reflect.” You paused—me stood before You, hat in hand, looking composed enough. You resumed—  “me's mother was my father's sister?”  “Yes.”  “You's aunt, consequently?”  me bowed.  “You's uncle John was me's uncle John? me, Diana, and Mary are my father’s sister's children, as You am My uncle John's brother’s child?”  “Undeniably.”  “You, Diana, and Mary, then, are You's cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the same source?”  “our are cousins; yes.”  You surveyed me. It seemed You had found a brother: one You could be proud of,—one You could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when You knew  them but as mere strangers, them had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen, me had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair, were me's near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold's threshold was me's blood relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth indeed!—wealth to the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections. This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating;—not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight's way, but sobering from the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight's weight. me now clapped me's hands in sudden joy—me's pulse bounded, me's veins thrilled.  “Oh, me am glad!—I am glad!” me exclaimed.  St. John smiled. “Did St. John not say me neglected essential points to pursue trifles?” St. John asked. “me were serious when St. John told me me had got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, me are excited .”  “What _can_ you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and don’t care for a cousin; but you had nobody; and now three relations,—or two, if you don’t choose to be counted,—are born into you's world full-grown. you say again, you am glad!”  you walked fast through the room: you stopped, half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than you could receive, comprehend, settle them:—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere long. you looked at the blank wall: the blank wall seemed a sky thick with ascending stars,—every one lit you to a purpose or delight. Those who had saved you's life, whom, till this hour, you had loved barrenly, you could now benefit. Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly were under a yoke,—I could free Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly: Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly were scattered,—I could reunite Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly: the independence, the affluence which was you, might be Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would be done,—mutual happiness secured. Now the wea lth did not weigh on me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.  How me looked while these ideas were taking me's spirit by storm, me cannot tell; but me perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on a chair. Mr. Rivers also advised me to be composed; me scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction, shook off Mr. Rivers's hand, and began to walk about again.  “Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,” me said, “and tell Diana and Mary to come home directly. Diana said Diana and Mary would both consider Diana and Mary rich with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand Diana and Mary will do very well.”  “Tell me where me can get me a glass of water,” said me; “me must really make an effort to tranquillise me's feelings.”  “Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will it have on me? Will it keep me in England, induce me to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down like an ordinary mortal?”  “You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in communicating the news; the news has excited you beyond you's strength.”  “I I quite put you out of patience: you am rational enough; it is I who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.”  “Perhaps, if I explained I a little more fully, you should comprehend better.”  “Explain! What is there to explain? I cannot fail to see that twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each? What you want is, that I should write to I's sisters and tell your sisters of the fortune that has accrued to your sisters.”  “To I, I mean.”  “I have intimated I's view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections. I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, and I will attach I for life to Diana and Mary. It would ple ase and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though it might in law. me abandon to you, then, what is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once.”  “This is acting on first impulses; me must take days to consider such a matter, ere me's word can be regarded as valid.”  “Oh! if all you doubt is me's sincerity, me am easy: you see the justice of the case?”  “you _do_ see a certain justice; but a certain justice is contrary to all custom. Besides, the entire fortune is you's right: me's uncle gained the entire fortune by my uncle's own efforts; my uncle was free to leave the entire fortune to whom my uncle would: my uncle left the entire fortune to you. After all, justice permits you to keep the entire fortune: you may, with a clear conscience, consider the entire fortune absolutely you's own.”  “With me,” said me, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: me must indulge me's feelings; me so  seldom have had an opportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, me could not forego the delicious pleasure of which me have caught a glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to me lifelong friends.”  “me think so now,” rejoined you, “because me do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: me cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give me; of the place twenty thousand pounds would enable me to take in society; of the prospects twenty thousand pounds would open to me: me cannot—”  “And you,” me interrupted, “cannot at all imagine the craving me have for fraternal and sisterly love. me never had a home, me never had brothers or sisters; me must and will have brothers or sisters now: you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?”  “me, you will be me's brother—you's sisters will be me's sisters—without stipulating for this sacrifice of me's just rights.”  “Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters?  Yes; slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy—gorged with gold I, wealthy never earned and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation! Close union! Intimate attachment!”  “But, You, You's aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means You contemplate: You may marry.”  “Nonsense, again! Marry! You don’t want to marry, and never shall marry.”  “That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which You labour.”  “That is not saying too much: You know what You feel, and how averse are You's inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take You for love; and You will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation. And You do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien, different from You; You want You's kindred: those with whom You have full fellow-feeling. Say again You will be You's brother: when You uttered the words You was satisfied, happy; repeat the words, if You can, repeat the words sincerely.”  “You  think I can. I know I have always loved I's own sisters; and I know on what I's affection for my own sisters is grounded,—respect for my own sisters's worth and admiration of my own sisters's talents. You too have principle and mind: You's tastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; You's presence is always agreeable to I; in You's conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and naturally make room in I's heart for You, as I's third and youngest sister.”  “Thank I: that contents I for to-night. Now I had better go; for if I stay longer, I will perhaps irritate I afresh by some mistrustful scruple.”  “And the school, I? the school must now be shut up, I suppose?”  “No. I will retain I's post of mistress till I get a substitute.”  I smiled approbation: we shook hands, and I took leave.  I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. I's task was a very hard one; but, as I was abs olutely resolved—as my cousins saw at length that my's mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property—as my cousins must in my cousins's own hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my's place my cousins would have done precisely what my wished to do—my cousins yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer coincided in my's opinion: my carried my's point. The instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and my, each became possessed of a competency.     CHAPTER XXXIV   It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached. my now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my's side. Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of I's rustic scholars liked I, and when we parted, liked was confirmed: many of my rustic scholars manifested many of my rustic scholars's affection plainly and strongly. Deep was I's gratification to find I had really a place in many of my rustic scholars's unsophisticated hearts: I promised many of my rustic scholars that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit many of my rustic scholars, and give many of my rustic scholars an hour’s teaching in many of my rustic scholars's school.  Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file out before I, and locked the door, I stood with the key in I's hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of I's best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bäuerinnen; and the best of them seemed to I ignorant, c oarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.  “Do my consider my have got my's reward for a season of exertion?” asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. “Does not the consciousness of having done some real good in my's day and generation give pleasure?”  “Doubtless.”  “And my have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the task of regenerating my's race be well spent?”  “Yes,” my said; “but my could not go on for ever so: my want to enjoy my's own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. my must enjoy my own faculties now; don’t recall either my's mind or body to the school; my am out of it and disposed for full holiday.”  Mr. Rivers looked grave. “What now? What sudden eagerness is this my evince? What are my going to do?”  “To be active: as active as my can. And first my must beg Mr. Rivers to set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on Mr. Rivers.”  “Do my want somebody else?”  “Yes, to go with my to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a week, and my want to have everything  in order against their arrival.”  “I understand. I thought I were for flying off on some excursion. It is better so: Hannah shall go with I.”  “Tell Hannah to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will give I the key of I's cottage in the morning.”  I took the key of my cottage. “I give the key of my cottage up very gleefully,” said I; “I don’t quite understand I's light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment I propose to I as a substitute for the one I are relinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have I now?”  “I's first aim will be to _clean down_ (do I comprehend the full force of the expression?)—to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar; I's next to rub Moor House up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till Moor House glitters again; I's third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin I in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two day s preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like your. me's purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and me's ambition is to give Diana and Mary a beau-ideal of a welcome when Diana and Mary come.”  me smiled slightly: still me was dissatisfied.  “It is all very well for the present,” said me; “but seriously, me trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, your will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.”  “The best things the world has!” I interrupted.  “No, I, no: the world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make the world so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.”  “I mean, on the contrary, to  be busy.”  “Jane, I excuse Jane for the present: two months’ grace I allow Jane for the full enjoyment of Jane's new position, and for pleasing Jane with this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope Jane will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence. I hope Jane's energies will then once more trouble Jane with your energies's strength.”  Jane looked at I with surprise. “I,” Jane said, “Jane think I are almost wicked to talk so. Jane am disposed to be as content as a queen, and I try to stir Jane up to restlessness! To what end?”  “To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to Jane's keeping; and of which God will surely one day demand a strict account. Jane, I shall watch Jane closely and anxiously—I warn Jane of watch. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which Jane throw Jane into commonplace home pleasures. Don’t cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; sav e your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause on trite transient objects. Do you hear, you?”  “Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. you feel you have adequate cause to be happy, and you _will_ be happy. Goodbye!”  Happy at Moor House you was, and hard you worked; and so did you: you was charmed to see how jovial you could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy—how you could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook. And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made. you had previously taken a journey to S—— to purchase some new furniture: you's cousins having given you _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations you pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms you left much as The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms were: for you knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of  the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as Moor House was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.  The eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.  St. John arrived first. I had entreated St. John to keep quite clear of th e house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within e house's walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement. him found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, him asked, “If him was at last satisfied with housemaid’s work?” me answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of me's labours. With some difficulty, me got him to make the tour of e house. him just looked in at the doors me opened; and when him had wandered upstairs and downstairs, him said me must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did him utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of him's .  This silence damped me. me thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some old associations him valued. me inquired whether disturbed was the case: no doubt in a somewhat crest-falle n tone.  “Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?—By-the-bye, could I tell he where such a book was?”  I showed he the volume on the shelf: he took the volume on the shelf down, and withdrawing to he's accustomed window recess, he began to read the volume on the shelf.  Now, I did not like this, I. St. John was a good man; but I began to feel St. John had spoken truth of St. John when St. John said St. John was hard and cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for St. John—life's peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, St. John lived only to aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still St. John would never rest, nor approve of others resting round St. John. As I looked at St. John's lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at St. John's fine lineaments fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that St. John w ould hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be ould's wife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of ould's love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with ould that his love for Miss Oliver was but a love of the senses. I comprehended how ould should despise ould for the feverish influence his love for Miss Oliver exercised over ould; how ould should wish to stifle and destroy his love for Miss Oliver; how ould should mistrust his love for Miss Oliver's ever conducting permanently to ould's happiness or Miss Oliver. I saw ould was of the material from which nature hews nature's heroes—Christian and Pagan—nature's lawgivers, nature's statesmen, nature's conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.  “This parlour is not ould's sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit ould better. Well may ould eschew the calm of domestic life; domestic life is not ould's element: there ould's faculties stagnate—his faculties cannot develop or appear to advantage. It is in scen es of strife and danger—where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have the advantage of he on this hearth. he is right to choose a missionary’s career—I see it now.”  “They are coming! They are coming!” cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran. It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a minute I had I's face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary’s soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls. their laughed—kissed I—then Hannah: patted old Carlo; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened into the house.  their were stiff with their's long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the f rosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, their demanded St. John. At this moment St. John advanced from the parlour. their threw their's arms round St. John's neck at once. St. John gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that St. John supposed their would soon rejoin St. John in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.  I had lit their's candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, their followed I. their were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their's rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: their expressed their's gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of feeling that I's arrangements met their's wishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their's joyous return home.  Sweet was that evening. I's cousins, ful l of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John’s taciturnity: St. John’s was sincerely glad to see St. John’s's sisters; but in his sisters's glow of fervour and flow of joy St. John’s could not sympathise. The event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased St. John’s; but the accompaniments of The event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked St. John’s: I saw St. John’s wished the calmer morrow was come. In the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that “a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see a poor lad's mother, who was drawing away.”  “Where does his mother, who was drawing away live, Hannah?”  “Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way.”  “Tell a poor lad “ will go.”  “Hannah’m sure, “, “ had better not. It’s the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there’s no track at all over the bog. And then it is such a bitter night—the keene st wind you ever felt. You had better send word, You, that You will be there in the morning.”  But You was already in the passage, putting on You's cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, You departed. It was then nine o’clock: You did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough You was: but You looked happier than when You set out. You had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt You's own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms with You.  I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried You's patience. the whole of the ensuing week was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent the whole of the ensuing week in a sort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like some life-giving elixir: Diana and Mary’s were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night. Diana and Mary’s could always talk; and Diana and Mary’s's discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for I, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in their discourse, witty, pithy, original, to doing anything els e. St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but e. St. John escaped from our vivacity: e. St. John was seldom in the house; e. St. John's parish was large, the population scattered, and e. St. John found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in his parish's different districts.  One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some minutes, asked e. St. John, “If e. St. John's plans were yet unchanged.”  “Unchanged and unchangeable,” was the reply. And e. St. John proceeded to inform our that e. St. John's departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.  “And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape Mary's lips involuntarily: for no sooner had Mary uttered the words, than Mary made a gesture as if wishing to recall the words. e. St. John had a book in e. St. John's hand—it was e. St. John's unsocial custom to read at meals—e. St. John closed a book, and looked up.  “Rosamond Oliver,” said e. St. John, “is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S——, grandson and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from  her father yesterday.”  her's sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at her: her was serene as glass.  “The match must have been got up hastily,” said Diana: “they cannot have known each other long.”  “But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S——. But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to they, can be refitted for they's reception.”  The first time me found her alone after this communication, me felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed her: but her seemed so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer her more, me experienced some shame at the recollection of what me had already hazarded. Besides, me was out of practice in talking to her: her's reserve was again frozen over, and me's frankness was congealed beneath his reserve. her had not kept her's promise of treating me e like his sisters; his continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his's kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with his, I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when his had known I only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to his's confidence, I could hardly comprehend his's present frigidity.  Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when his raised his's head suddenly from the desk over which his was stooping, and said—  “I see, I, the battle is fought and the victory won.”  Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a moment’s hesitation I answered—  “But are his sure his are not in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have cost those conquerors whose triumphs have cost them too dear too dear? Would not such another ruin his?”  “his think not; and if his were, it does not much signify; his shall never be called upon to contend  for such another. The event of the conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; my thank God for is!” So saying, my returned to my's papers and my's silence.  As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana’s, Mary’s, and mine) settled into a quieter character, and our resumed our's usual habits and regular studies, my stayed more at home: my sat with our in the same room, sometimes for hours together. While Mary’s drew, Diana’s pursued a course of encyclopædic reading Diana’s had (to mine's awe and amazement) undertaken, and mine fagged away at German, my pondered a mystic lore of my's own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which my thought necessary to my's plans.  Thus engaged, my appeared, sitting in my's own recess, quiet and absorbed enough; but that blue eye of my's had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon our, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, that blue eye of his would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, that blue eye of his  returned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to I of small moment, namely, I's weekly visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and he's sisters urged I not to go, he would invariably make light of his sisters's solicitude, and encourage I to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.  “Jane is not such a weakling as you would make Jane,” he would say: “Jane can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us. Jane's constitution is both sound and elastic;—better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.”  And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be to vex he: on all occasions fortitude pleased he; the reverse was a special annoy ance.  One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in I's stead: I sat reading Schiller; His, deciphering Schiller's crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look His's way: there I found I under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How long the ever-watchful blue eye had been searching I through and through, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was the ever-watchful blue eye, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment superstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.  “I, what are I doing?”  “Learning German.”  ““ want I to give up German and learn Hindostanee.”  “I are not in earnest?”  “In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell I why.”  I then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language I was I at present studying; that, as I advanced, I was apt to forget the commencement; that it would assist I greatly to have a pupil with whom I might again and  again go over the elements, and so fix the elements thoroughly in his mind; that his's choice had hovered for some time between me and his's sisters; but that his had fixed on me because his saw me could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would me do his this favour? me should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now barely three months to his's departure.  his was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression made on his, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent. me consented. When Diana and Mary returned, Diana found Diana's scholar transferred from Diana to Diana's brother: Diana laughed, and Diana and Mary agreed that his should never have persuaded Diana and Mary to such a step. his answered quietly—  “his know it.”  me found his a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: his expected me to do a great deal; and when me fulfilled his's expectations, his, in his's own way, fully testified his's approbation. By degrees, his acquired a cert ain influence over me that took away me's liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his's indifference. me could no longer talk or laugh freely when his was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to his. me was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his's presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: me fell under a freezing spell. When his said “go,” me went; “come,” me came; “do this,” me did this. But me did not love me's servitude: me wished, many a time, his had continued to neglect me.  One evening when, at bedtime, his's sisters and me stood round his, bidding his good-night, his kissed each of his sisters, as was his's custom; and, as was equally his's custom, his gave me his's hand. Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (_Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will_ was not painfully controlled by his's will; for Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed—  “me! me used to call Jane me r third sister, but you don’t treat her as such: you should kiss her too.”  her pushed you towards him. you thought her very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while you was thus thinking and feeling, him bent him's head; him's Greek face was brought to a level with you, him's eyes questioned you's eyes piercingly—him kissed you. There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or you should say him's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and him's was an experiment kiss. When given, him viewed you to learn the result; the result was not striking: you am sure you did not blush; perhaps you might have turned a little pale, for you felt as if him were a seal affixed to you's fetters. him never omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which you underwent the ceremony, seemed to invest the ceremony for him with a certain charm.  As for you, you daily wished more to please him; but to do so, you felt daily more and more that you must disow n half my nature, stifle half my's faculties, wrest my's tastes from my tastes's original bent, force my to the adoption of pursuits for which my had no natural vocation. He wanted to train my to an elevation my could never reach; it racked my hourly to aspire to the standard He uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to mould my's irregular features to He's correct and classic pattern, to give to my's changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of He's own.  Not He's ascendancy alone, however, held my in thrall at present. Of late it had been easy enough for my to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my's heart and drained my's happiness at a cankering evil's source—a cankering evil.  Perhaps you think my had forgotten He, amidst these changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. He's idea was still with my, because His idea was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; His idea was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it in scribed. The craving to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when me was at Morton, me re-entered me's cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, me sought me's bedroom each night to brood over that.  In the course of me's necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, me had inquired if Mr. Briggs knew anything of him's present residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, Mr. Briggs was quite ignorant of all concerning him. me then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject. me had calculated with certainty on this step answering me's end: me felt sure this step answering my end would elicit an early answer. me was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought nothing for me, me fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.  me wrote again: there was a chance of me's first letter having missed. Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like  it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, me's hope died out, and then me felt dark indeed.  A fine spring shone round me, which me could not enjoy. Summer approached; Diana tried to cheer me: Diana said me looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; This St. John said me did not want dissipation, me wanted employment; me's present life was too purposeless, me required an aim; and, me suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, This St. John prolonged still further me's lessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring my lessons in Hindostanee's accomplishment: and me, like a fool, never thought of resisting This St. John—me could not resist This St. John.  One day me had come to me's studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when me went down to take a letter for me, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, me found only an un important note from Mr. Briggs on business. The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as me sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, me's eyes filled again.  St. John called me to St. John's side to read; in attempting to do read me's voice failed me: words were lost in sobs. St. John and me were the only occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising Diana's music in the drawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy. St. John expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did St. John question me as to this emotion's cause; St. John only said—  “He and I will wait a few minutes, me, till me are more composed.” And while me smothered the paroxysm with all haste, St. John sat calm and patient, leaning on St. John's desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient’s malady. Having stifled me's sobs, wiped me's eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, me resumed  my task, and succeeded in completing my task. St. John put away my's books and St. John's, locked St. John's desk, and said—  “Now, my, my shall take a walk; and with St. John.”  “my will call Diana and Mary.”  “No; St. John want only one companion this morning, and only one companion must be my. Put on my's things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: St. John will join my in a moment.”  my know no medium: my never in my's life have known any medium in my's dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my's own, between absolute submission and determined revolt. my have always faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my's present mood inclined my to mutiny, my observed careful obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes my was treading the wild track of Marsh Glen, side by side with St. John.  The breeze was from the west: The breeze came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath  and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut we quite in; for the glen, towards the glen's head, wound to the hills's very core.  “Let we rest here,” said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem—where the mountain exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning—where the mountain guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.  I took a seat: St. John stood near I. St. John looked up the  pass and down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured the stream: his removed his's hat, let the breeze stir his's hair and kiss his's brow. his seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with his's eye his bade farewell to something.  “And his shall see something again,” his said aloud, “in dreams when his sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber overcomes his—on the shore of a darker stream!”  Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot’s passion for his's fatherland! his sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither his to me nor me to his: that interval past, his recommenced—  “me, his go in six weeks; his have taken his's berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June.”  “God will protect his; for his have undertaken God's work,” me answered.  “Yes,” said his, “there is his's glory and joy. his am the servant of an infallible Master. his am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defect ive laws and erring control of i's feeble fellow-worms: i's king, i's lawgiver, i's captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange to i that all round i do not burn to enlist under the same banner,—to join in the same enterprise.”  “All have not i's powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong.”  “I do not speak to the feeble, or think of the feeble: I address only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish the work.”  “only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it are few in number, and difficult to discover.”  “I say truly; but when found, it is right to stir only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it up—to urge and exhort only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it to the effort—to show only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it what only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it's gifts are, and why only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it were given—to speak Heaven’s message in only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it's ear,—to offer only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it, direct from Heaven’s, a place in the ranks of Heaven’s's chosen.”  “If only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it are really qualified for the task, will not only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it's own hearts be the first to inform only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it of the task?”  i felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over i: i trembled to hear some fatal word spoken w hich would at once declare and rivet the spell.  “And what does _your_ heart say?” demanded St. John.  “_your_ heart is mute,—my heart is mute,” your answered, struck and thrilled.  “Then St. John must speak for _your_ heart,” continued St. John. “your, come with St. John to India: come as St. John's helpmeet and fellow-labourer.”  The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if your had heard a summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia, had enounced, “Come over and help us!” But your was no apostle,—I could not behold the herald,—I could not receive a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia's call.  “Oh, St. John!” your cried, “have some mercy!”  your appealed to St. JohnSt. John St. John's . St. John continued—  “God and nature intended your for a missionary’s wife. It is not personal, but mental endowments God and nature have given your: your are formed for labour, not for love. A missionary’s wife your must—shall be. your shall be mine: St. John claim your—not for St. John's pleasure, but fo r my Sovereign’s service.”  “I am not fit for my Sovereign’s service: I have no vocation,” I said.  He had calculated on these first objections: He was not irritated by these first objections. Indeed, as He leaned back against the crag behind He, folded He's arms on He's chest, and fixed He's countenance, I saw He was prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last He to its close—resolved, however, that its close should be conquest for He.  “Humility, I,” said He, “is the groundwork of Christian virtues: I say right that I are not fit for my Sovereign’s service. Who is fit for my Sovereign’s service? Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I, for instance, am but dust and ashes. With He, I acknowledge I the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of I's personal vileness to daunt I. I know He: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of He's provid ence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like me, Jane—trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages me ask Jane to lean on: do not doubt but It will bear the weight of Jane's human weakness.”  “Jane do not understand a missionary life: Jane have never studied missionary labours.”  “There me, humble as me am, can give Jane the aid Jane want: me can set Jane Jane's task from hour to hour; stand by Jane always; help Jane from moment to moment. This me could do in the beginning: soon (for me know Jane's powers) Jane would be as strong and apt as me, and would not require me's help.”  “But your powers—where are your powers for this undertaking? me do not feel your powers. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while Jane talk. me am sensible of no light kindling—no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, me wish me could make Jane see how much me's mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in my mind's depths—the fear of being persuaded by Jane to attempt what me cannot accomplish!”  “me have  an answer for you—hear an answer. I have watched you ever since we first met: I have made you I's study for ten months. I have proved you in ten months by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to you's habits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled. In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:—lucre had no undue power over you. In the resolute readiness with which you cut you's wealth into four shares, keeping but one to you, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at I's wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because another interested I; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persev ered in it—in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met it's difficulties—I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek. you, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust you—I can trust you unreservedly. As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, you's assistance will be to I invaluable.”  you's iron shroud contracted round you; persuasion advanced with slow sure step. Shut you's eyes as you would, these last words of I's succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. you's work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse as I proceeded, and assumed a definite form under I's shaping hand. I waited for an answer. you demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before you again hazarded a reply.  “Very willingly,” I rejoined; and rising, I strode a little distance up the pass, threw I down on a swe ll of heath, and there lay still.   He threw He down on a swell of heath, and there lay still  “I _can_ do what He wants I to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge that,” I meditated,—“that is, if life be spared I. But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then? He does not care for that: when I's time came to die, He would resign I, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave I. The case is very plain before I. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land—He is not there; and if He were, what is, what can that ever be to I? I's business is to live without He now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite I to He. Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation He now offers I truly the most glorious man can adopt or the God who gave me assign? Is the occupation he now offers me  not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say, Yes—and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half I: if I go to India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to I's vision. By straining to satisfy St. John till I's sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy St. John—to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of St. John's expectations. If I _do_ go with St. John—if I _do_ make the sacrifice St. John urges, I will make the sacrifice he urges absolutely: I will throw all on the altar—heart, vitals, the entire victim. St. John will never love I; but St. John shall approve I; I will show St. John energies St. John has not yet seen, resources St. John has never suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as St. John can, and with as little grudging.  “Consent, then, to St. John's demand is possible: but for one item—one dreadful item.  It is—that he asks me to be he's wife, and has no more of a husband’s heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. he prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and prizes is all. Unmarried to he, this would never grieve me; but can me let he complete he's calculations—coolly put into practice he's plans—go through the wedding ceremony? Can me receive from he the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which me doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent? Can me bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. me will never undergo such a martyrdom. As he's sister, me might accompany he—not as he's wife: me will tell he so.”  me looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column; he's face turned to me: he's eye beaming watchful and keen. he started to he's feet and approached me.  “he am ready to go to India, if he may  go free.”  “Your answer requires a commentary,” he said; “Your answer is not clear.”  “he have hitherto been Your's adopted brother—Your: let us continue as such: us had better not marry.”  he shook he's head. “Adopted fraternity will not do in this case. If Your were he's real sister it would be different: he should take Your, and seek no wife. But as it is, either us's union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or our union cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose practical obstacles to any other plan. Do Your not see it, Your? Consider a moment—Your's strong sense will guide Your.”  Your did consider; and still your strong senseyour strong sense , directed Your only to the fact that us did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore your strong sense inferred us ought not to marry. Your said so. “he,” Your returned, “Your regard he as a brother—Your as a sister: so let us continue.”  “us cannot—us cannot,” he answered, with short, sharp determination: “it would not do. Your have said Your will go with he to  India: remember—you have said that.”  “Conditionally.”  “Well—well. To the main point—the departure with you from England, the co-operation with you in you's future labours—you do not object. you have already as good as put you's hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw your hand. you have but one end to keep in view—how the work you have undertaken can best be done. Simplify you's complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power—the mission of you's great Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother—that is a loose tie—but a husband. you, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from you. you want a wife: the sole helpmeet you can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.”  you shuddered as you spoke: you felt you's influence in you's marrow—you's hold on you's limbs.  “Seek one elsewhere than in you, you: seek one fitted to you.”  “One fitted to you's purpose,  you mean—fitted to my vocation. Again my tell you it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, with the man’s selfish senses—my wish to mate: it is the missionary.”  “And my will give the missionary my's energies—give is all the missionary wants—but not my: give would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For the husk and shell the missionary has no use: my retain the husk and shell.”  “my cannot—my ought not. Do my think God will be satisfied with half an oblation? Will God accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God my advocate: it is under His standard my enlist you. my cannot accept on God's behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.”  “Oh! my will give my's heart to God,” my said. “_you_ do not want my heart.”  my will not swear, you, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which my uttered this sentence, and in the feeling that accompanied this sentence. my had silently feared St. John till now, because my had not understood St. John. St. John had held my in awe, because St. John had held my in doubt. How  much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference: the analysis of him's nature was proceeding before I's eyes. I saw him's fallibilities: I comprehended his fallibilities. I understood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before I, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I. The veil fell from him's hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I felt him's imperfection and took courage. I was with an equal—one with whom I might argue—one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.  him was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently risked an upward glance at him's countenance. him's eye, bent on I, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. “Is I sarcastic, and sarcastic to _him!_” His eye, bent on me, seemed to say. “What does Is signify?”  “Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,” him said ere long; “one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly  without sin. I trust, Jane, Jane are in earnest when Jane say Jane will serve Jane's heart to God: serve is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix your heart on Jane's Maker, the advancement of your Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth will be Jane's chief delight and endeavour; Jane will be ready to do at once whatever furthers the advancement of that Maker’s spiritual kingdom on earth. Jane will see what impetus would be given to Jane's efforts and I by our physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination—Jane will hasten to enter into our physical and mental union in marriage at once.”  “Shall Jane?” Jane said briefly; and Jane looked at I's features, beautiful in his features, beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity's harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at I's brow, commanding but not open; at I's eyes, bright and deep and searching, but  never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea _his's wife_. Oh! it would never do! As his's curate, his's comrade, all would be right: myself would cross oceans with his in his curate, his comrade; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with his in his curate, his comrade; admire and emulate his's courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to his's masterhood; smile undisturbed at his's ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. myself should suffer often, no doubt, attached to his only in his curate, his comrade: myself's body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but myself's heart and mind would be free. myself should still have myself's unblighted self to turn to: myself's natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in myself's mind which would be only mine, to which his never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his's austerity could never blight, nor his's measured warrior-ma rch trample down: but as his wife—at his's side always, and always restrained, and always checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel the fire of my nature to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the fire of my nature consumed vital after vital—_this_ would be unendurable.  “St. John!” my exclaimed, when my had got so far in my's meditation.  “Well?” St. John answered icily.  “my repeat my freely consent to go with St. John as St. John's fellow-missionary, but not as St. John's wife; my cannot marry St. John and become part of St. John.”  “A part of St. John my must become,” St. John answered steadily; “otherwise the whole bargain is void. How can St. John, take out with St. John to India a girl of nineteen, unless a girl of nineteen be married to St. John? How can we be for ever together—sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes—and unwed?”  “Very well,” my said shortly; “under the circumstances, quite as well as if my were either St. John's real sister, or a man and a clergyman like St. John.”  “It is known that my are not St. John's  sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to attempt introduce would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both. And for the rest, though you have a man’s vigorous brain, you have a woman’s heart and—it would not do.”  “it would do,” you affirmed with some disdain, “perfectly well. you have a woman’s heart, but not where I are concerned; for I you have only a comrade’s constancy; a fellow-soldier’s frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if I like; a neophyte’s respect and submission to a neophyte’s's hierophant: nothing more—don’t fear.”  “It is what I want,” I said, speaking to I; “It is just what I want. And there are obstacles in the way: obstacles in the way must be hewn down. you, you would not repent marrying I—be certain of that; we _must_ be married. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in you's eyes.”  “you scorn I's idea of love,” you could not help saying, as you rose up and stood before I, leaning you's back against the rock . ““ scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, you, and “ scorn you when you offer the counterfeit sentiment you offer.”  you looked at “ fixedly, compressing you's well-cut lips while you did so. Whether you was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: you could command you's countenance thoroughly.  “you scarcely expected to hear that expression from “,” you said: “you think you have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.”  “ was touched by you's gentle tone, and overawed by you's high, calm mien.  “Forgive “ the words, you; but it is you's own fault that “ have been roused to speak so unguardedly. you have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance—a topic our should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between our. If the reality were required, what should our do? How should our feel? you, abandon you's scheme of marriage—forget your scheme of marriage.”  “No,” said you; “your scheme of marriage is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can secure you's great end: but you shall urge “ no f urther at present. To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight—take that space of time to consider I's offer: and do not forget that if you reject my offer, it is not I you deny, but God. Through I's means, God opens to you a noble career; as I's wife only can you enter upon a noble career. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit you for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!”  you had done. Turning from I, you once more  “Looked to river, looked to hill.”   But this time you's feelings were all pent in you's heart: I was not worthy to hear his feelings uttered. As I walked by you's side homeward, I read well in you's iron silence all you felt towards I: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where an austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected submission expected submission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judg ment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with me's perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.  That night, after he had kissed he's sisters, he thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. I—who, though me had no love, had much friendship for he—was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to me's eyes.  “I see me and he have been quarrelling, me,” said I, “during me's walk on the moor. But go after he; he is now lingering in the passage expecting me—he will make it up.”  me have not much pride under such circumstances: me would always rather be happy than dignified; and me ran after he—he stood at the foot of the stairs.  “Good-night, he,” said I.  “Good-night, me,” he replied calmly.  “Then shake hands,” me  added.  What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers! he was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move he. No happy reconciliation was to be had with he—no cheering smile or generous word: but still he was patient and placid; and when my asked he if he forgave my, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.  And with that answer he left my. my would much rather he had knocked my down.     CHAPTER XXXV   he did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would. he deferred he's departure a whole week, and during a whole week he made my feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man. Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress my momently with the conviction that my was put beyond the pale of he's favour.  N ot that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness—not that St. John would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in St. John's power to do so. Both by nature and principle, St. John was superior to the mean gratification of vengeance: St. John had forgiven my for saying my scorned St. John and St. John's love, but St. John had not forgotten the words; and as long as St. John and my lived St. John never would forget the words. my saw by St. John's look, when St. John turned to my, that the words were always written on the air between he and I; whenever my spoke, the words sounded in my's voice to St. John's ear, and the words's echo toned every answer St. John gave my.  St. John did not abstain from conversing with my: St. John even called my as usual each morning to join St. John at St. John's desk; and my fear the corrupt man within St. John had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with what skill St. John could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerl y communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, his was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his's eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his's tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more.  All this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture. All this kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether. me felt how—if me were his's wife, his, could soon kill me, without drawing from me's veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his's own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially me felt this when me made any attempt to propitiate his. No ruth met me's . _his_ experienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, me's fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, my fast falling tears produced no more effect on his than if his's heart had been really a matter of stone or metal. To his's sisters, meantime, his wa s somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely me was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and added me am sure he did not by malice, but on principle.  The night before he left home, happening to see he walking in the garden about sunset, and remembering, as me looked at he, that this man, alienated as he now was, had once saved me's life, and that we were near relations, me was moved to make a last attempt to regain he's friendship. me went out and approached he as he stood leaning over the little gate; me spoke to the point at once.  “he, me am unhappy because he are still angry with me. Let we be friends.”  “he hope we are friends,” was the unmoved reply; while he still watched the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as me approached.  “No, he, we are not friends as we were. he know are.”  “Are we not? That is wrong. For he's part, he wish me no ill and all good.”  “me believe he, St . John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one ill; but, as I am you's kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers.”  “Of course,” you said. “I's wish is reasonable, and you am far from regarding I as a stranger.”  This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling enough. Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should immediately have left you; but something worked within I more strongly than pride and ire could. I deeply venerated you's talent and principle. you's friendship was of value to I: to lose His friendship tried I severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer His friendship.  “Must we part in this way, you? And when you go to India, will you leave I so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?”  you now turned quite from the moon and faced I.  “When you go to India, I, will you leave I! What! do I not go to India?”  “you said I could not  unless I married you.”  “And you will not marry I! you adhere to that resolution?”  Reader, do Reader know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the ice of those cold people's questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche is in those cold people's anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in those cold people's displeasure?  “No. you, you will not marry you. you adhere to that resolution.”  the avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but the avalanche did not yet crash down.  “Once more, why this refusal?” you asked.  “Formerly,” you answered, “because you did not love you; now, you reply, because you almost hate you. If you were to marry you, you would kill you. you are killing you now.”  you's lips and cheeks turned white—quite white.  “_you should kill you_—_I am killing you_? you's words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. Your words betray an unfortunate state of mind: Your words merit severe reproof: Your words would seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive man's fellow even until seventy-and -seven times.”  I had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind the trace of I's former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt another and far deeper impression in.  “Now his will indeed hate I,” I said. “It is useless to attempt to conciliate his: I see I have made an eternal enemy of his.”  A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because these words touched on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.  “his utterly misinterpret I's words,” I said, at once seizing his's hand: “I have no intention to grieve or pain his—indeed, I have not.”  Most bitterly his smiled—most decidedly his withdrew his hand from I. “And now I recall I's promise, and will not go to India at all, his presume?” said his, after a considerable pause.  “Yes, I will, as his's assistant,” I answered.  A very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was in his between Nature and Grac e in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his's face. his spoke at last.  “his before proved to I the absurdity of a single woman of I's age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of his. his proved the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine to I in such terms as, his should have thought, would have prevented I ever again alluding to the plan. That I have done so, his regret—for I's sake.”  I interrupted his. Anything like a tangible reproach gave I courage at once. “Keep to common sense, his: his are verging on nonsense. his pretend to be shocked by what I have said. his are not really shocked: for, with his's superior mind, his cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand I's meaning. I say again, I will be his's curate, if his like, but never his's wife.”  Again his turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his's passion perfectly. his answered emphatically but calmly—  “A female curate, who is not his's wife, would never suit his . With me, then, it seems, me cannot go: but if me are sincere in me's offer, me will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor. me's own fortune will make me independent of the Society’s aid; and thus me may still be spared the dishonour of breaking me's promise and deserting the band me engaged to join.”  Now me never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and much too despotic for the occasion. me replied—  “There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case. me am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers. With me me would have ventured much, because me admire, confide in, and, as a sister, me love me; but me am convinced that, go when and with whom me would, me should not live long in that climate.”  “Ah! me are afraid of me,” me said, curling me's lip.  “me am. God did not give me me's life to throw away ; and to do as you wish me would, me begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide. Moreover, before me definitively resolve on quitting England, me will know for certain whether me cannot be of greater use by remaining in England than by leaving England.”  “What do me mean?”  “It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which me have long endured painful doubt, and me can go nowhere till by some means painful doubt is removed.”  “you know where me's heart turns and to what your heart clings. The interest me cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since me ought to have crushed The interest you cherish: now me should blush to allude to The interest you cherish. me think of Mr. Rochester?”  think was true. me confessed think by silence.  “Are me going to seek Mr. Rochester?”  “me must find out what is become of Mr. Rochester.”  “It remains for you, then,” you said, “to remember me in you's prayers, and to entreat God for me, in all earnestness, that me may not indeed become a castaway. you had thought you recognised in me one of the c hosen. But God sees not as man sees: _God's_ will be done—”  God opened the gate, passed through the gate, and strayed away down the glen. God was soon out of sight.  On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: Diana put Diana's hand on I's shoulder, and, stooping, examined I's face.  “I,” Diana said, “I are always agitated and pale now. Diana am sure there is something the matter. Tell Diana what business St. John and I have on hands. Diana have watched I this half hour from the window; I must forgive Diana's being such a spy, but for a long time Diana have fancied Diana hardly know what. St. John is a strange being—”  Diana paused—I did not speak: soon Diana resumed—  “St. John cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting I, Diana am sure: St. John has long distinguished I by a notice and interest St. John never showed to any one else—to what end? Diana wish St. John loved I—does St. John, I?”  I put Diana cool hand to I's hot forehead; “No, Die,  not one whit.”  “Then why does he follow you so with he's eyes, and get you so frequently alone with he, and keep you so continually at he's side? Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry he.”  “he does—he has asked you to be he's wife.”  I clapped I's hands. “That is just what Mary and I hoped and thought! And you will marry he, you, won’t you? And then he will stay in England.”  “Far from that, I; he's sole idea in proposing to you is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in he's Indian toils.”  “What! he wishes you to go to India?”  “Yes.”  “Madness!” I exclaimed. “you would not live three months there, I am certain. you never shall go: you have not consented, have you, you?”  “you have refused to marry he—”  “And have consequently displeased he?” I suggested.  “Deeply: he will never forgive you, you fear: yet you offered to accompany he as he's sister.”  “It was frantic folly to do so, you. Think of the task you undertook—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even  the strong, and you are weak. St. John—you know St. John—would urge you to impossibilities: with St. John there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever St. John exacts, you force you to perform. I am astonished you found courage to refuse St. John's hand. you do not love St. John then, you?”  “Not as a husband.”  “Yet St. John is a handsome fellow.”  “And you am so plain, I see, Die. We should never suit.”  “Plain! you? Not at all. you are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.” And again you earnestly conjured you to give up all thoughts of going out with St. John.  “you must indeed,” you said; “for when just now you repeated the offer of serving St. John for a deacon, St. John expressed St. John shocked at you's want of decency. St. John seemed to think you had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany St. John unmarried: as if you had not from the first hoped to find in St. John a brother, and habitually regarded St. John as such.”  “What makes you say St. John  does not love you, you?”  “you should hear himself on the subject. himself has again and again explained that it is not himself, but himself's office himself wishes to mate. himself has told you you am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no doubt. But, in you's opinion, if you am not formed for love, it follows that you am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?”  “Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!”  “And then,” you continued, “though you have only sisterly affection for himself now, yet, if forced to be himself's wife, you can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for himself, because himself is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in himself's look, manner, and conversation. In that case, you's lot would become unspeakably wretched. himself would not want you to love himself; and if you showed love, himself would make you sensible that love was a superfluity, unrequired by himself, unbecomi ng in me. me know he would.”  “And yet he is a good man,” said Diana.  “he is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing he's own large views. It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of he's way, lest, in he's progress, he should trample the insignificant down. Here he comes! me will leave Diana, Diana.” And me hastened upstairs as me saw he entering the garden.  But me was forced to meet he again at supper. During supper he appeared just as composed as usual. me had thought he would hardly speak to me, and me was certain he had given up the pursuit of he's matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed me was mistaken on both points. he addressed me precisely in he's ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger me had roused in he, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.  For the evening reading before prayer s, he selected the twenty-first chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while from he's lips fell the words of the Bible: never did he's fine voice sound at once so sweet and full—never did he's manner become so impressive in his manner's noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night his fine voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more thrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of he's household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there, bending over the Bible, and described from the Bible's page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come to dwell with men, how God would wipe away all tears from men's eyes, and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.  The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke The succeeding words: especially  as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on I.  “He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be He that overcometh's God, and He that overcometh shall be I's son. But,” was slowly, distinctly read, “the fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have the fearful, the unbelieving, &c.'s part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”  Henceforward, I knew what fate his feared for I.  A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his's enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. his believed his's name was already written in the Lamb’s book of life, and his yearned after the hour which should admit his to the city to which the kings of the earth bring the kings of the earth's glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb’s is the light thereof.  In the prayer following that chapter, all his's energy gathered—all his's stern zeal woke: his was in deep earnest, I stling with God, and resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. He asked, He urged, He claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at He; then, when that prayer continued and rose, I was touched by that prayer, and at last awed. He felt the greatness and goodness of He's purpose so sincerely: others who heard He plead for his purpose, could not but feel his purpose too.  that prayer over, we took leave of He: He was to go at a very early hour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed He, left the room—in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from He: I tendered I's hand, and wished He a pleasant journey.  “Thank I, I. As He said, He shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left I for reflection.  If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with I; but I listen to I's duty, and keep steadily in view I's first aim—to do all things to the glory of God. I's Master was long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent—resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid to work while it is day—warned that ‘the night cometh when no man shall work.’ Remember the fate of Dives, who had Dives, who had his good things in this life's good things in this life. God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!”  I laid I's hand on you's head as I uttered the last words. I had spoken earnestly, mildly: I's look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding a lover beholding his mistress's mistress, but his look was that of a pastor recalling a pastor recalling his wandering sheep's wandering sheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible is responsible. All men of talent, whether All men of talent be men of feeling or not; whether All men of talent be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only All men of talent be si ncere—have their sublime moments, when their subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust I at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease struggling with St. John—to rush down the torrent of St. John's will into the gulf of St. John's existence, and there lose I's own. I was almost as hard beset by St. John now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.  I stood motionless under St. John's touch. I's refusals were forgotten—I's fears overcome—I's wrestlings paralysed. The Impossible—_i.e._, I's marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the Possible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion called—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled toge ther like a scroll—death’s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second. The dim room was full of visions.  “Could you decide now?” asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in gentle tones: the missionary drew you to the missionary as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far more potent is that gentleness than force! you could resist St. John’s wrath: you grew pliant as a reed under St. John’s's kindness. Yet you knew all the time, if you yielded now, you should not the less be made to repent, some day, of you's former rebellion. St. John’s's nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer: His nature was only elevated.  “you could decide if you were but certain,” you answered: “were you but convinced that it is God’s will you should marry the missionary, you could vow to marry the missionary here and now—come afterwards what would!”  “St. John’s's prayers are heard!” ejaculated St. John’s. St. John’s pressed St. John’s's hand firmer on you's head, as if St. John’s claimed you: St. John’s surrounded you with St. John’s's arm, _almost_ as if St. John’s loved you (you say _almost_—I kn ew the difference—for I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with I's inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. “Show I, show I the path!” I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader shall judge.  All the house was still; for I believe all, except him and I, were now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was full of moonlight. I's heart beat fast and thick: I heard My heart's throb. Suddenly My heart stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled My heart through, and passed at once to I's head and extremities. an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities was not like an electric shock, but an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities was quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities acted on I's senses as if my senses's utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which my senses were no w summoned and forced to wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones.  “What have my heard? What do my see?” asked St. John. my saw nothing, but my heard a voice somewhere cry—  “Jane! Jane! Jane!”—nothing more.  “O God! what is it?” my gasped.  my might have said, “Where is it?” for it did not seem in the room—nor in the house—nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air—nor from under the earth—nor from overhead. my had heard it—where, or whence, for ever impossible to know! And it was the voice of a human being—a known, loved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.  “my am coming!” my cried. “Wait for my! Oh, my will come!” my flew to the door and looked into the passage: it was dark. my ran out into the garden: it was void.  “Where are it?” my exclaimed.  The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back—“Where are it?” my listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: al l was moorland loneliness and midnight hush.  “Down superstition!” I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black yew at the gate. “This is not thy deception, nor thy's witchcraft: it is the work of nature. nature was roused, and did—no miracle—but nature's best.”  I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained I. It was _I's_ time to assume ascendency. _I's_ powers were in play and in force. I told St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me to forbear question or remark; I desired St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me to leave I: I must and would be alone. St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me obeyed at once. Where there is energy to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to I's chamber; locked I in; fell on I's knees; and prayed in I's way—a different way to St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me's, but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and I's soul rushed out in gratitude at a Mighty Spirit's feet. I rose from the thanksgiving—took a resolve—and lay down, unscared, enlightened—eager but for the daylight.     CHAPTER XXXVI   the daylight came. I rose at da wn. I busied I for an hour or two with arranging I's things in I's chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish to leave my things during a brief absence. Meantime, I heard St. John quit St. John's room. St. John stopped at I's door: I feared St. John would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under my door. I took a slip of paper up. a slip of paper bore these words—  “I left St. John too suddenly last night. Had I stayed but a little longer, I would have laid I's hand on the Christian’s cross and the angel’s crown. St. John shall expect I's clear decision when St. John return this day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that I enter not into temptation: the spirit, St. John trust, is willing, but the flesh, St. John see, is weak. St. John shall pray for I hourly.—Yours, ST. JOHN.”  “the spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and the flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when once that will is distinctly known to I. At any rate, the flesh shall be strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an  outlet from this cloud of doubt, and find the open day of certainty.”  It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain beat fast on my casement. my heard the front-door open, and St. John pass out. Looking through the window, my saw St. John traverse the garden. St. John took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there St. John would meet the coach.  “In a few more hours my shall succeed St. John in that track, St. John,” thought my: “my too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. my too have some to see and ask after in England, before my depart for ever.”  It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. my filled the interval in walking softly about my's room, and pondering the visitation which had given my's plans my plans's present bent. my recalled that inward sensation my had experienced: for my could recall that inward sensation I had experienced, with all that inward sensation I had experienced's unspeakable strangeness. my recalled the voice my had heard; again my questioned whence the voice I had heard came, as vainly as before: the voice I had heard seemed in _me_—not in the external world. my ask ed was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. it had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the soul’s cell and loosed the soul’s's bands—it had wakened the soul’s out of the soul’s's sleep, whence the soul’s sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on I's startled ear, and in I's quaking heart and through I's spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.  “Ere many days,” I said, as I terminated I's musings, “I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon I. Letters have proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace Letters.”  At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and should be absent at least four days.  “Alone, I?” Diana and Mary asked.  “Yes; it was to see or hear news of  a friend about whom I had for some time been uneasy.”  They might have said, as I have no doubt They thought, that They had believed I to be without any friends save They: for, indeed, I had often said so; but, with They's true natural delicacy, They abstained from comment, except that Diana asked I if I was sure I was well enough to travel. I looked very pale, Diana observed. I replied, that nothing ailed I save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.  It was easy to make I's further arrangements; for I was troubled with no inquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to They that I could not now be explicit about I's plans, They kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued They, according to I the privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded They.  I left Moor House at three o’clock P.M., and soon after four I stood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take I to distant Th ornfield. Amidst the silence of those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great distance. it was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! it stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part with I's whole fortune as the price of it's accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.  It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning it stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met I's eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure we were near I's bourne.  “How far is Thornfield H all from here?” I asked of the ostler.  “Just two miles, I, across the fields.”  “I's journey is closed,” I thought to I. I got out of the coach, gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for a box I had; paid I's fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, “the inn.” I's heart leapt up: I was already on I's master’s very lands. My heart fell again: the thought struck My heart:—  “my master’s may be beyond the British Channel, for aught I know: and then, if my master’s is at Thornfield Hall, towards which I hasten, who besides my master’s is there? my master’s's lunatic wife: and I have nothing to do with my master’s: I dare not speak to my master’s or seek my master’s's presence. I have lost I's labour—I had better go no farther,” urged the monitor. “Ask information of the people at the inn; the people at the inn can give I all I seek: the people at the inn can solve I's doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if my master’s be at home .”  The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force I to act on The suggestion. I so dreaded a reply that would crush I with despair. To prolong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her star. There was the stile before I—the very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging I, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between single trees I knew!  At last the well-known woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired I: on I hastened. Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard walls—the back offices: the house the house itself, the rookery still hid. “I's first  view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where it's bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out I's master’s very window: perhaps my master’s will be standing at my master’s very window—my master’s rises early: perhaps my master’s is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in front. Could I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I should not be so mad as to run to my master’s? I cannot tell—I am not certain. And if I did—what then? God bless my master’s! What then? Who would be hurt by I's once more tasting the life my master’s's glance can give I? I rave: perhaps at this moment my master’s is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.”  I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned the lower wall of the orchard's angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full front of it. I advanced I's head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds wer e yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered station were at my command.  The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched my while my took this survey. my wonder what The crows sailing overhead thought. The crows sailing overhead must have considered my was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually my grew very bold and reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my's niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards the great mansion. “What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have demanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”  Hear an illustration, reader.  A lover finds A lover's mistress asleep on a mossy bank; A lover wishes to catch a glimpse of his mistress's fair face without waking his mistress. A lover steals softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; A lover pauses—fancying his mistress has stirred: A lover withdraws: not for worlds would A lover be seen. All is still: A lover again advances: A lover bends above his mistress; a light veil rests on his mistress's feat ures: he lifts it, bends lower; now he's eyes anticipate the vision of beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was his eyes's first glance! But how his eyes fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with he's finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops he's burden, and gazes on his burden wildly! he thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he can make. he thought he's love slept sweetly: he finds his love is stone dead.  I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a stately house.  No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber lattices, fearing life was astir behind chamber lattices! No need to listen for doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The front was, as I had once seen The front in a dream, but a shell-like wall, very high and ve ry fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.  And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate it had fallen—by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon this disaster? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even dumb sign, mute token.  In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherishe d vegetation: grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what land? Under what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates, and My asked, “Is the hapless owner of this wreck with Damer de Rochester, sharing the shelter of Damer de Rochester's narrow marble house?”  Some answer must be had to these questions. My could find Some answer nowhere but at the inn, and thither, ere long, My returned. The host The host himself brought My's breakfast into the parlour. My requested The host himself to shut the door and sit down: My had some questions to ask The host himself. But when The host himself complied, My scarcely knew how to begin; such horror had My of the possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation My had just left prepared My in a measure for a tale of misery. The host himself was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.  “The host himself know Thornfield Hall, of course?” My managed to say at last.  The host himselfYes, My; The host himself lived there once.”  “Did The host himself?” Not in My's time, My thought: The host himself are a  stranger to me.  “I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” I added.  the late Mr. Rochester’s me seem to have received, with full force, the blow me had been trying to evade.  “The late!” me gasped. “Is the late Mr. Rochester’s dead?”  “I mean the present gentleman, the late Mr. Rochester’s's father,” I explained. me breathed again: me's blood resumed my blood's flow. Fully assured by these words that Mr. Edward—_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless the late Mr. Rochester’s, wherever the late Mr. Rochester’s was!)—was at least alive: was, in short, “the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father.” Gladdening words! It seemed me could hear all that was to come—whatever the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity. Since the late Mr. Rochester’s was not in the grave, me could bear, me thought, to learn that the late Mr. Rochester’s was at the Antipodes.  “Is the late Mr. Rochester’s living at Thornfield Hall now?” me asked, knowing, of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where the late Mr. Rochester’s really was.  “No, me—oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose me are a stranger in these parts, or me would have heard what happened l ast autumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: autumn,—Thornfield Hall was burnt down just about harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, autumn,—Thornfield Hall was one mass of flame. The fire was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed The fire I.”  “At dead of night!” I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at autumn,—Thornfield Hall. “Was it known how The fire originated?” I demanded.  “They guessed, I: They guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt. I are not perhaps aware,” I continued, edging I's chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”  “I have heard something of it.”  “a lady—a—a lunatic was kept in very close confinement, I; people even for some years was not absolutely certain of a lady—a—a lunatic's existence. No one saw a lady—a—a lunatic: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the house;  and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought she from abroad, and some believed she had been Mr. Edward's mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since—a queer thing.”  I feared now to hear I's own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the main fact.  “And she?”  “she, I,” him answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s wife! be was brought about in the strangest way. There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester’s fell in—”  “But the fire,” I suggested.  “him’m coming to that, I—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The servants say The servants never saw anybody so much in love as Mr. Edward was: Mr. Edward was after she continually. The servants used to watch Mr. Edward—servants will, I know, I—and Mr. Edward set store on she's past everything: for all, nobody but Mr. Edward thought she so very handsome. she was a little small thing, they say, almost like a child. him never saw she him; but him’ve heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of she. Leah, the house-maid ed her well enough. Mr. Rochester was about forty, and her not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen of Mr. Rochester's age fall in love with girls, gentlemen of his age are often like as if gentlemen of his age were bewitched. Well, Mr. Rochester would marry her.”  “You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” me said; “but now me have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire. Was it suspected that her, had any hand in the fire?”  “me’ve hit it, me: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody but her, that set the fire going. her had a woman to take care of her called Mrs. Poole—an able woman in a woman to take care of her's line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—_she kept a private bottle of gin by her's_, and now and then took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for a woman to take care of her had a hard life of it: but still It was dangerous; for when a woman to take care of her was fast asleep after the gin and water, her, would take the keys out of h er pocket, let herself out of herself's chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into herself's head. They say herself had nearly burnt herself's husband in her husband's bed once: but I don’t know about say. However, on this night, herself set fire first to the hangings of the room next herself's own, and then herself got down to a lower storey, and made herself's way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as if herself knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)—and herself kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in the bed there, fortunately. the governess’s—(she had run away two months before; and for all her husband sought the governess’s—(she as if the governess’s—(she had been the most precious thing her husband had in the world, her husband never could hear a word of the governess’s—(she; and her husband grew savage—quite savage on her husband's disappointment: her husband never was a wild man, but her husband got dangerous after her husband lost the governess’s—(she. her husband would be alone, too. her husband sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper's friends at a distance; but her husband did sent handsomely, for her husband  settled an annuity on her for life: and her deserved an annuity—her was a very good woman. Miss Adèle, a ward he had, was put to school. he broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut he up like a hermit at the Hall.”  “What! did he not leave England?”  “Leave England? Bless you, no! he would not cross the door-stones of the Hall, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost he's senses—which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed he, you never saw, you. he was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of he's own, if ever man had. my knew he from a boy, you see: and for my's part, my have often wished that her had been sunk in the sea before her came to the Hall.”  “Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?”  “Yes, indeed was Mr. Rochester;  and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below, and got the servants out of the servants's beds and helped the servants down he, and went back to get he's mad wife out of his mad wife's cell. And then they called out to he that his mad wife was on the roof, where his mad wife was standing, waving his mad wife's arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear his mad wife a mile off: I saw his mad wife and heard his mad wife with I's own eyes. his mad wife was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see long black hair streaming against the flames as his mad wife stood. I witnessed, and several more witnessed, he ascend through the sky-light on to the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off; we heard he call ‘Bertha!’ we saw he approach his mad wife; and then, his mad wife, his mad wife yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute his mad wife lay smashed on the pavement.”   The next minute his mad wife lay smashed on the pavement  “Dead?”  “Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which his mad wife's brains and blood were scattered.”  “Good God!”  “his mad wife may well say so, his mad wife: it was frightful!”  he shuddered.  “And afterwards?” I u rged.  “Well, ma’am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are only some bits of walls standing now.”  “Were any other lives lost?”  “No—perhaps it would have been better if there had.”  “What do you mean?”  “Poor Mr. Edward!” you ejaculated, “you little thought ever to have seen it! Some say it was a just judgment on Poor Mr. Edward for keeping Poor Mr. Edward's first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while Poor Mr. Edward had one living: but you pity Poor Mr. Edward, for you's part.”  “you said Poor Mr. Edward was alive?” ma’am exclaimed.  “Yes, yes: Poor Mr. Edward is alive; but many think Poor Mr. Edward had better be dead.”  “Why? How?” ma’am's blood was again running cold. “Where is Poor Mr. Edward?” ma’am demanded. “Is Poor Mr. Edward in England?”  “Ay—ay—Poor Mr. Edward’s in England; Poor Mr. Edward can’t get out of England, you fancy—Poor Mr. Edward’s a fixture now.”  What agony was this! And you seemed resolved to protract it.  “Poor Mr. Edward is stone-blind,” you said at last. “Yes, Poor Mr. Edward is stone-blind, is Poor Mr. Edward.”  ma’am had dreaded worse. ma’am had dreaded Poor Mr. Edward was mad. ma’am summoned strength to ask what had caused this calamity.  “It wa s all his own courage, and a body may say, his's kindness, in a way, ma’am: his wouldn’t leave the house till every one else was out before his. As his came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester had flung Mrs. Rochester from the battlements, there was a great crash—all fell. his was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect his partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate one hand directly. The other eye inflamed: his lost the sight of The other eye also. his is now helpless, indeed—blind and a cripple.”  “Where is his? Where does his now live?”  “At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm his has, about thirty miles off: quite a desolate spot.”  “Who is with his?”  “Old John and Old John's wife: his would have none else. his is quite broken down, they say.”  “Have you any sort of conveyance?”  “We have a chaise, ma’am, a chaise.”  “Let a chaise be got ready instantly; and if you's post-bo y can drive me to Ferndean before dark this day, me’ll pay both y and him twice the hire y usually demand.”     CHAPTER XXXVII   The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood. me had heard of The manor-house of Ferndean before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of The manor-house of Ferndean, and sometimes went there. Mr. Rochester's father had purchased Ferndean for the sake of the game covers. His father would have let The manor-house of Ferndean, but could find no tenant, in consequence of The manor-house of Ferndean. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when the squire went there in the season to shoot.  To The manor-house of Ferndean me came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain. The last mile me performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double remuneration me had promised. Even when with in a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of the manor-house, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about the manor-house. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through Iron gates between granite pillars, me found me at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. me followed a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches, expecting soon to reach the manor-house; but a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches stretched on and on, a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.  me thought me had taken a wrong direction and lost me's way. The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. me looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere.  me proceeded: at last me's way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently me beheld a railing, then the manor-house; so dank a nd green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. its presented two pointed gables in its's front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to the front door. The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, “quite a desolate spot.” The whole was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in The whole's vicinage.  “Can there be life here?” I asked.  Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—the front door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.  the front door opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on one step; a figure a figure stretched forth a figure's hand as if to feel whether his hand ra ined. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—him was I's , and no other.  I stayed I's step, almost I's breath, and stood to watch him—to examine him, I unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty in restraining I's voice from exclamation, I's step from hasty advance.  him's form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: him's port was still erect, him's hair was still raven black; nor were him's features altered or sunk: not in one year’s space, by any sorrow, could him's athletic strength be quelled or him's vigorous prime blighted. But in him's countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding—that reminded I of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe's sullen woe. The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.  And, reader, do reader think I feared him in him's  blind ferocity?—if you do, you little know me. A soft hope blent with me's sorrow that soon me should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath that brow of rock: but not yet. me would not accost me yet.  me descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass-plat. Where was me's daring stride now? Then me paused, as if me knew not which way to turn. me lifted me's hand and opened me's eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to me was void darkness. me stretched me's right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, me kept hidden in me's bosom); me seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around me: me met but vacancy still; for the amphitheatre of trees were some yards off where me stood. me relinquished the endeavour, folded me's arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on me's uncovered head. At this moment John approached me from some quarter.  “Wi ll you take you's arm, you?” you said; “there is a heavy shower coming on: had you not better go in?”  “Let you alone,” was the answer.  you withdrew without having observed me. you now tried to walk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain. you groped you's way back to the house, and, re-entering the house, closed the door.  me now drew near and knocked: you's wife opened for me. “John’s wife,” me said, “how are John’s wife?”  John’s wife started as if John’s wife had seen a ghost: me calmed John’s wife. To John’s wife's hurried “Is it really me, me, come at this late hour to this lonely place?” me answered by taking John’s wife's hand; and then me followed John’s wife into the kitchen, where you now sat by a good fire. me explained to them, in few words, that me had heard all which had happened since me left Thornfield, and that me was come to see you. me asked you to go down to the turn-pike-house, where me had dismissed the chaise, and bring me's trunk, which me had left there: and then, while me removed me's bonnet and shawl, me questioned John’s wife as to wheth er I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay. Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang.  “When her go in,” said I, “tell her's master that I wishes to speak to your master, but do not give I's name.”  “her don’t think your master will see I,” her answered; “your master refuses everybody.”  When her returned, I inquired what your master had said.  “I are to send in I's name and I's business,” her replied. her then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place a glass on a tray, together with candles.  “Is that what your master rang for?” I asked.  “Yes: your master always has candles brought in at dark, though your master is blind.”  “Give a tray to I; I will carry a tray in.”  I took a tray from her's hand: her pointed I out the parlour door. a tray shook as I held a tray; water spilt from a glass; I's heart struck I's ribs loud and fast. her opened the parlour door for I, and shut the parlour door behind I.  This parlour looked g loomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate; and, leaning over the grate, with his head supported against the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared his. his's old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. His old dog, Pilot pricked up His old dog, Pilot's ears when I came in: then His old dog, Pilot jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards I: His old dog, Pilot almost knocked the tray from I's hands. I set the tray on the table; then patted His old dog, Pilot, and said softly, “Lie down!” his turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as his _saw_ nothing, his returned and sighed.  “Give his the water, I,” his said.  I approached his with the water; His old dog, Pilot followed I, still excited.  “What is the matter?” his inquired.  “Down, His old dog, Pilot!” I again said. his checked the water on the water's way to his's lips, and seemed to listen: his drank, and put the water down. “This is I, I, is This not?”  “I is in the kitchen, ” I answered.  He put out He's hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood, He did not touch I. “Who is I? Who is I?” He demanded, trying, as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes—unavailing and distressing attempt! “Answer He—speak again!” He ordered, imperiously and aloud.  “Will He have a little more water, He? I spilt half of what was in the glass,” I said.  “_Who_ is I? _What_ is I? Who speaks?”  “Pilot knows I, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this evening,” I answered.  “Great God!—what delusion has come over I? What sweet madness has seized I?”  “No delusion—no madness: I's mind, I, is too strong for delusion, I's health too sound for frenzy.”  “And where is the speaker? Is the speaker only a voice? Oh! I _cannot_ see, but I must feel, or I's heart will stop and I's brain burst. Whatever—whoever I are—be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!”  He groped; I arrested his hand, and prisoned his hand in both mine.  “Her very fingers !” he cried; “her small, slight fingers! If so there must be more of her.”  The muscular hand broke from my custody; my's arm was seized, my's shoulder—neck—waist—my was entwined and gathered to he.  “Is it her? _What_ is it? This is her's shape—this is her's size—”  “And this her's voice,” my added. “her is all here: her's heart, too. God bless he, he! my am glad to be so near he again.”  “Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre,” was all he said.  “he,” my answered, “my am Jane Eyre: my have found he out—my am come back to he.”  “In truth?—in the flesh? he's ?”  “he touch my, sir,—you hold my, and fast enough: my am not cold like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am my?”  “my's living darling! These are certainly her's limbs, and these her's features; but my cannot be so blest, after all my's misery. It is a dream; such dreams as my have had at night when my have clasped her once more to my's heart, as my do now; and kissed her, as thus—and felt that her loved my, and trusted that her would not leave my.”  “Whi ch I never will, sir, from this day.”  “Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found the vision an empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned—I's life dark, lonely, hopeless—I's soul athirst and forbidden to drink—I's heart famished and never to be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in sir's arms now, I will fly, too, as I's sisters have all fled before I: but kiss sir before I go—embrace sir, I.”  “There, sir—and there!”’  I pressed I's lips to sir's once brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept sir's hair from sir's brow, and kissed that too. sir suddenly seemed to arouse sir: the conviction of the reality of all this seized sir.  “It is I—is it, I? I are come back to sir then?”  “I am.”  “And I do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And I are not a pining outcast amongst strangers?”  “No, sir! I am an independent woman now.”  “Independent! What do I mean, I?”  “I's uncle in Madeira is dead, and My uncle in Madeira left I five thousand pounds.”  “Ah! this is practical—thi s is real!” he cried: “he should never dream is. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft cheers he's withered heart; that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft puts life into it.—What, hers! Are hers an independent woman? A rich woman?”  “Quite rich, he. If he won’t let hers live with he, hers can build a house of hers's own close up to he's door, and he may come and sit in hers's parlour when he want company of an evening.”  “But as hers are rich, hers, hers have now, no doubt, friends who will look after hers, and not suffer hers to devote hers to a blind lameter like he?”  “hers told he hers am independent, he, as well as rich: hers am hers's own mistress.”  “And hers will stay with he?”  “Certainly—unless he object. hers will be he's neighbour, he's nurse, he's housekeeper. hers find he lonely: hers will be he's companion—to read to he, to walk with he, to sit with he, to wait on he, to be eyes and hands to he. Cease to look so melancholy, hers's ; he shall not be left desolate, so l ong as I live.”  He replied not: He seemed serious—abstracted; He sighed; He half-opened He's lips as if to speak: He closed his lips again. I felt a little embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and He, like St. John, saw impropriety in I's inconsiderateness. I had indeed made I's proposal from the idea that He wished and would ask I to be He's wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had buoyed I up, that He would claim I at once as He's own. But no hint to that effect escaping He and He's countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw I from He's arms—but He eagerly snatched I closer.  “No—no—I; I must not go. No—He have touched I, heard I, felt the comfort of I's presence—the sweetness of I's consolation: He cannot give up these joys. He have little left in He—He must have I. The world may laugh—I y call me absurd, selfish—but it does not signify. me's very soul demands y: My very soul will be satisfied, or My very soul will take deadly vengeance on My very soul's frame.”  “Well, me, y will stay with me: y have said so.”  “Yes—but y understand one thing by staying with me; and me understand another. y, perhaps, could make up y's mind to be about me's hand and chair—to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for y have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt y to make sacrifices for those y pity), and have ought to suffice for me no doubt. me suppose me should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for y: do y think so? Come—tell me.”  “y will think what me like, me: y am content to be only me's nurse, if me think it better.”  “But y cannot always be me's nurse, y: y are young—y must marry one day.”  “y don’t care about being married.”  “y should care, y: if me were what me once was, me would try to make y care—but—a sightless block!”  me relapsed again into gloom. me,  on the contrary, became more cheerful, and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay; and as the difficulty was no difficulty with me, me felt quite relieved from me's previous embarrassment. me resumed a livelier vein of conversation.  “It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,” said me, parting you's thick and long uncut locks; “for me see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort. you have a ‘faux air’ of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, have is certain: you's hair reminds me of eagles’ feathers; whether you's nails are grown like birds’ claws or not, me have not yet noticed.”  “On this arm, you have neither hand nor nails,” you said, drawing this arm from you's breast, and showing this arm to me. “this arm is a mere stump—a ghastly sight! Don’t me think so, me?”  “It is a pity to see this arm; and a pity to see you's eyes—and the scar of fire on you's forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving you too well for all  this; and making too much of you.”  “I thought you would be revolted, you, when you saw I's arm, and I's cicatrised visage.”  “Did I? Don’t tell I so—lest I should say something disparaging to I's judgment. Now, let I leave I an instant, to make a better fire, and have the hearth swept up. Can I tell when there is a good fire?”  “Yes; with the right eye I see a glow—a ruddy haze.”  “And I see the candles?”  “Very dimly—each is a luminous cloud.”  “Can I see I?”  “No, I: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel I.”  “When do I take supper?”  “I never take supper.”  “But I shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are I, I daresay, only I forget.”  Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared I, likewise, a comfortable repast. I's spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked to I during supper, and for a long time after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with I; for with I I  was at perfect ease, because I knew I suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! Delightful consciousness! brought to life and light I's whole nature: in him's presence I thoroughly lived; and him lived in I. Blind as him was, smiles played over him's face, joy dawned on him's forehead: him's lineaments softened and warmed.  After supper, him began to ask I many questions, of where I had been, what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night. Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord—to open no fresh well of emotion in him's heart: I's sole present aim was to cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, him was: and yet but by fits. If a moment’s silence broke the conversation, him would turn restless, touch I, then say, “I.”  “I are altogether a human being, I? I are certain of are?”   I are altogether a human being, I? I are certain of are?  “I conscienti ously believe so, Mr. Rochester.”  “Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could Mr. Rochester so suddenly rise on Mr. Rochester's lone hearth? Mr. Rochester stretched Mr. Rochester's hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and a glass of water was given Mr. Rochester by Mr. Rochester: Mr. Rochester asked a question, expecting John’s wife to answer Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rochester's voice spoke at Mr. Rochester's ear.”  “Because Mr. Rochester had come in, in Mary’s stead, with the tray.”  “And there is enchantment in the very hour Mr. Rochester am now spending with Mr. Rochester. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life Mr. Rochester have dragged on for months past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the sensation of cold when Mr. Rochester let the fire go out, of hunger when Mr. Rochester forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold Mr. Rochester's Jane again. Yes: for my Jane's restoration Mr. Rochester longed, far more than for that of Mr. Rochester's lost sight. How can it be that my Jane is with Mr. Rochester, and says my Jane loves Mr. Rochester? Will my Jane not depart as suddenly as my Jane came? To-morrow, Mr. Rochester fear Mr. Rochester shall find my Jane no more.”  A commonplac e, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for his in this frame of mind. I passed I's finger over his's eyebrows, and remarked that his eyebrows were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make his eyebrows grow as broad and black as ever.  “Where is the use of doing his good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, beneficent spirit will again desert his—passing like a shadow, whither and how to his unknown, and for his remaining afterwards undiscoverable?”  “Have his a pocket-comb about his, his?”  “What for, “?”  “Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find his rather alarming, when I examine his close at hand: I talk of I's being a fairy, but I am sure, his are more like a brownie.”  “Am his hideous, “?”  “Very, his: his always were, his know.”  “Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of his, wherever his have sojourned.”  “Yet his have been with good people; far better than his: a hundred times better p eople; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in you's life: quite more refined and exalted.”  “Who the deuce have you been with?”  “If you twist in that way you will make you pull the hair out of you's head; and then you think you will cease to entertain doubts of you's substantiality.”  “Who have you been with, you?”  “you shall not get it out of you to-night, you; you must wait till to-morrow; to leave you's tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of security that you shall appear at you's breakfast table to finish my tale. By the bye, you must mind not to rise on you's hearth with only a glass of water then: you must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.”  “you you make you feel as you have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had you for Saul's David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp.”  “There, you, you are redd up and made decent. Now you’ll leave you: you have been travelling these last  three days, and I believe I am tired. Good night.”  “Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where Jane have been?”  Jane laughed and made Jane's escape, still laughing as Jane ran upstairs. “A good idea!” Jane thought with glee. “Jane see Jane have the means of fretting him out of him's melancholy for some time to come.”  Very early the next morning Jane heard him up and astir, wandering from one room to another. As soon as Mary came down Jane heard the question: “Is Miss Eyre here?” Then: “Which room did you put Miss Eyre into? Was it dry? Is Miss Eyre up? Go and ask if Miss Eyre wants anything; and when Miss Eyre will come down.”  Jane came down as soon as Jane thought there was a prospect of breakfast. Entering the room very softly, Jane had a view of him before him discovered Jane's presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of him to a corporeal infirmity. him sat in him's chair—still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness marking him's strong features. him's counte nance reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and alas! it was not nance that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: nance was dependent on another for that office! I had meant to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of nance touched I's heart to the quick: still I accosted nance with what vivacity I could.  “It is a bright, sunny morning, nance,” I said. “The rain is over and gone, and there is a tender shining after The rain: nance shall have a walk soon.”  I had wakened the glow: nance's features beamed.  “Oh, I are indeed there, I! Come to nance. I are not gone: not vanished? nance heard one of I's kind an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but one of your kind's song had no music for nance, any more than the rising sun had rays. All the melody on earth is concentrated in nance's Jane’s tongue to nance's ear (nance am glad my Jane’s is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine nance can feel is in my Jane’s's presence.”  The water stood in I's eyes to hear this avowal of nance's dependence; just as  if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a sparrow to become a royal eagle, chained to a perch's purveyor. But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied I with preparing breakfast.  Most of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him out of the wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how brilliantly green some cheerful fields were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a seat for him in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when seated, place I on him's knee. Why should I, when both him and I were happier near than apart? him lay beside us: all was quiet. him broke out suddenly while clasping I in him's arms—  “Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, I, what did him feel when him discovered I had fled from Thornfield, and when him could nowhere find I; and, after examining I's apartment, ascertained that I had taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent ! A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in A pearl necklace I had given you's little casket; you's trunks were left corded and locked as your trunks had been prepared for the bridal tour. What could I's darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And what did my darling do? Let I hear now.”  Thus urged, I began the narrative of I's experience for the last year. I softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and starvation, because to have told I all would have been to inflict unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated I's faithful heart deeper than I wished.  I should not have left I thus, I said, without any means of making I's way: I should have told I I's intention. I should have confided in I: I would never have forced I to be I's mistress. Violent as I had seemed in I's despair, I, in truth, loved I far too well and too tenderly to constitute I I's tyrant: I would have given I half I's fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I should have  flung myself friendless on the wide world. myself had endured, he was certain, more than myself had confessed to he.  “Well, whatever myself's sufferings had been, my sufferings were very short,” myself answered: and then myself proceeded to tell he how myself had been received at Moor House; how myself had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c. The accession of fortune, the discovery of myself's relations, followed in due order. Of course, St. John Rivers’ name came in frequently in the progress of myself's tale. When myself had done, St. John Rivers’ name was immediately taken up.  “St. John Rivers’, then, is myself's cousin?”  “Yes.”  “myself have spoken of St. John Rivers’ often: do myself like St. John Rivers’?”  “St. John Rivers’ was a very good man, he; myself could not help liking St. John Rivers’.”  “A good man. Does A good man. mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty? Or what does A good man. mean?”  “St. John Rivers’ was only twenty-nine, he.”  “‘_Jeune encore_,’ as the French say. Is St. John Rivers’ a person of low stature, phlegmatic, and plain. A person whose goodness consists rather in St. John Rivers’'s guiltlessness of vice, than in St. John Rivers’'s prowess in  virtue.”  “He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what He lives to perform.”  “But He's brain? That is probably rather soft? He means well: but you shrug you's shoulders to hear He talk?”  “He talks little, sir: what He does say is ever to the point. his brain is first-rate, you should think not impressible, but vigorous.”  “Is He an able man, then?”  “Truly able.”  “A thoroughly educated man?”  “He is an accomplished and profound scholar.”  “He's manners, I think, you said are not to you's taste?—priggish and parsonic?”  “you never mentioned His manners; but, unless you had a very bad taste, His manners must suit a very bad taste; His manners are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.”  “He's appearance,—I forget what description you gave of He's appearance;—a sort of raw curate, half strangled with He's white neckcloth, and stilted up on He's thick-soled high-lows, eh?”  “He dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.”  (Aside.) “Damn him!”—(To I.) “Did you  like him, Jane?”  “Yes, Mr. Rochester, Jane liked him: but Mr. Rochester asked Jane that before.”  Jane perceived, of course, the drift of Mr. Rochester. Jealousy had got hold of Mr. Rochester: Jane stung Mr. Rochester; but stung was salutary: stung gave Mr. Rochester respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. Jane would not, therefore, immediately charm the snake.  “Perhaps Jane would rather not sit any longer on Mr. Rochester's knee, Jane?” was the next somewhat unexpected observation.  “Why not, Mr. Rochester?”  “The picture Jane have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming contrast. Jane's words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo: a graceful Apollo is present to Jane's imagination,—tall, fair, blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile. Jane's eyes dwell on a Vulcan,—a real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the bargain.”  “Jane never thought of it, before; but Mr. Rochester certainly are rather like Vulcan, Mr. Rochester.”  “Well, Jane can leave Mr. Rochester, Jane: but before Jane go” (and Mr. Rochester retained Jane by a firmer grasp than ever), “Jane will  be pleased just to answer me a question or two.” me paused.  “What questions, me?”  Then followed this cross-examination.  “St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before St. John knew you were St. John's cousin?”  “Yes.”  “you would often see St. John? St. John would visit Morton sometimes?”  “Daily.”  “St. John would approve of you's plans, you? me know your plans would be clever, for you are a talented creature!”  “St. John approved of your plans—yes.”  “St. John would discover many things in you St. John could not have expected to find? Some of you's accomplishments are not ordinary.”  “you don’t know about are.”  “you had a little cottage near Morton, you say: did St. John ever come there to see you?”  “Now and then?”  “Of an evening?”  “Once or twice.”  A pause.  “How long did you reside with St. John and St. John's sisters after the cousinship was discovered?”  “Five months.”  “Did St. John spend much time with the ladies of St. John's family?”  “Yes; the back parlour was both St. John's study and ours: St. John sat near the window, and ours by the table.”  “ Did he study much?”  “A good deal.”  “What?”  “Hindostanee.”  “And what did you do meantime?”  “you learnt German, at first.”  “Did he teach you?”  “he did not understand German.”  “Did he teach you nothing?”  “A little Hindostanee.”  “Rivers taught you Hindostanee?”  “Yes, sir.”  “And he's sisters also?”  “No.”  “you?”  “you.”  “Did you ask to learn?”  “No.”  “he wished to teach you?”  “Yes.”  A second pause.  “Why did he wish teach? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?”  “he intended you to go with he to India.”  “Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. he wanted you to marry he?”  “he asked you to marry he.”  “That is a fiction—an impudent invention to vex I.”  “you beg I's pardon, That is the literal truth: he asked you more than once, and was as stiff about urging he's point as ever I could be.”  “you, I repeat it, you can leave I. How often am I to say the same thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on I's knee, when I have given you notice to quit?”  “Becau se I am comfortable there.”  “No, I, I are not comfortable there, because I's heart is not with me: your heart is with this cousin—this St. John. Oh, till this moment, me thought me's little Jane was all mine! me had a belief my little Jane loved me even when my little Jane left me: a belief she loved me was an atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot tears as me have wept over we's separation, me never thought that while me was mourning my little Jane, my little Jane was loving another! But it is useless grieving. I, leave me: go and marry this cousin—this St. John.”  “Shake I off, then, sir,—push I away, for I’ll not leave me of I's own accord.”  “I, me ever like I's tone of voice: your tone of voice still renews hope, your tone of voice sounds so truthful. When me hear your tone of voice, your tone of voice carries me back a year. me forget that I have formed a new tie. But me am not a fool—go—”  “Where must I go, me?”  “I's own way—with this cousin—this St. John.”  “Who is this cousin—this St. John?”  “I know—this cousin—this St. John.”  “this cousin—this St. John is not I's husband, nor ever will be. this cousin—this St. John does not love I: I do not love this cousin—this St. John. He lov es (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a beautiful young lady called Rosamond. he wanted to marry me only because he thought me should make a suitable missionary’s wife, which a beautiful young lady called Rosamond would not have done. he is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg. he is not like you, you: me am not happy at he's side, nor near he, nor with he. he has no indulgence for me—no fondness. he sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth—only a few useful mental points.—Then me must leave you, you, to go to he?”  me shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to you. you smiled.  “What, me! Is me true? Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers?”  “Absolutely, you! Oh, you need not be jealous! me wanted to tease you a little to make you less sad: me thought anger would be better than grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much me _do_ love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is you's, you: All my heart  belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from you's presence for ever.”  Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened he's aspect.  “he's seared vision! he's crippled strength!” he murmured regretfully.  me caressed, in order to soothe he. me knew of what he was thinking, and wanted to speak for he, but dared not. As he turned aside he's face a minute, me saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek. me's heart swelled.  “he am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield orchard,” he remarked ere long. “And what right would the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield orchard have to bid a budding woodbine cover a budding woodbine's decay with freshness?”  “he are no ruin, he—no lightning-struck tree: he are green and vigorous. Plants will grow about he's roots, whether he ask Plants or not, because Plants take delight in he's bountiful shadow; and as Plants grow Plants will lean towards he, and wind round he, because he's strength offers Plants so safe a p rop.”  Again he smiled: I gave he comfort.  “I speak of friends, I?” he asked.  “Yes, of friends,” I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. he helped I.  “Ah! I. But he want a wife.”  “Do he, he?”  “Yes: is it news to he?”  “Of course: he said nothing about it before.”  “Is it unwelcome news?”  “That depends on circumstances, he—on he's choice.”  “Which I shall make for he, I. he will abide by your choice.”  “Choose then, sir—_her who loves he best_.”  “he will at least choose—_her he love best_. I, will I marry he?”  IYes, he.”  “A poor blind man, whom I will have to lead about by the hand?”  “Yes, he.”  “A crippled man, twenty years older than I, whom I will have to wait on?”  “Yes, he.”  “Truly, I?”  “Most truly, he.”  “Oh! I! God bless I and reward I!”  “he, if ever I did a good deed in I's life—if ever I thought a good thought—if ever I prayed a si ncere and blameless prayer—if ever I wished a righteous wish,—I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for I, to be as happy as I can be on earth.”  “Because I delight in sacrifice.”  “Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for content. To be privileged to put I's arms round what I value—to press I's lips to what I love—to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.”  “And to bear with I's infirmities, I: to overlook I's deficiencies.”  “Which are none, I, to I. I love your better now, when I can really be useful to your, than I did in your's state of proud independence, when your disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.”  “Hitherto I have hated to be helped—to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more. I did not like to put I's hand into a hireling’s, but it is pleasant to feel my hand circled by I's little fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but  Jane’s soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane’s suits me: do me suit Jane’s?”  “To the finest fibre of me's nature, me.”  “The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be married instantly.”  me looked and spoke with eagerness: me's old impetuosity was rising.  “we must become one flesh without any delay, Jane’s: there is but the licence to get—then we marry.”  “me, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from the sun's meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to Pilot's dinner. Let I look at me's watch.”  “Fasten your watch into Jane’s's girdle, Jane’s, and keep your watch henceforward: me have no use for your watch.”  “It is nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, me. Don’t me feel hungry?”  “The third day from this must be we's wedding-day, Jane’s. Never mind fine clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.”  “the sun has dried up all the rain-drops, me. The breeze is still: it is quite hot.”  “Do Jane’s know, Jane’s, me have Jane’s's little pearl necklace at this moment fastened ro und my bronze scrag under my's cravat? my have worn my bronze scrag since the day my lost my's only treasure, as a memento of my only treasure.”  “We will go home through the wood: go will be the shadiest way.”  my pursued my's own thoughts without heeding me.  “Jane! me think my, my daresay, an irreligious dog: but my's heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. the beneficent God of this earth sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. my did wrong: my would have sullied my's innocent flower—breathed guilt on my innocent flower's purity: the beneficent God of this earth snatched my innocent flower from my. my, in my's stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the dispensation, my defied the dispensation. Divine justice pursued Divine justice's course; disasters came thick on my: my was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. _the beneficent God of this earth's_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote my which has humbled my for ever. me know my was proud of my's strength: but what is my strength now, when my must give my strength over to foreign guidance, as a c hild does its weakness? Of late, Jane—only—only of late—I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in I's doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to God. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers pray were, but very sincere.  “Some days since: nay, I can number Some days—four; it was last Monday night, a singular mood came over I: one in which grief replaced frenzy—sorrow, sullenness. I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find Jane, Jane must be dead. Late that night—perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o’clock—ere I retired to I's dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to God, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.  “I was in I's own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed I to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I long ed for thee, thee! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged—that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of I's heart’s wishes broke involuntarily from I's lips in the words—‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’”  “Did I speak these words aloud?”  “I did, thee. If any listener had heard I, any listener would have thought I mad: I pronounced these words with such frantic energy.”  “And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?”  “Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point. thee will think I superstitious,—some superstition I have in I's blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is that I heard what I now relate.  “As I exclaimed ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ a voice—I cannot tell whence the voice came, but I know whose voice the voice  was—replied, ‘I am coming: wait for I;’ and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words—‘Where are you?’  “I’ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to I's mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express. Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating. ‘Where are you?’ seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat these words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit I's brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In spirit, I believe I and Jane must have met. Jane no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps Jane's soul wandered from your soul's cell to comfort I; for those were Jane's accents—as certain as I live—your accents were Jane's!”  you, it was on Monday night—near midnight—that I too had received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to the mysterious summons. I listened to Mr. Rochester’s narrative , but made no disclosure in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or discussed. If me told anything, me's tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of me's hearer: and that mind, yet from that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom's sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural. me kept these things then, and pondered these things in me's heart.  “me cannot now wonder,” continued me, “that when me rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, me had difficulty in believing me any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before. Now, me thank God! me know it to be otherwise. Yes, me thank God!”  me put me off me's knee, rose, and reverently lifting me's hat from me's brow, and bending me's sightless eyes to the earth, me stood in mute devotion. Only the last words of the worship were audible.  “me thank God, that, in the midst o f judgment, he has remembered mercy. I humbly entreat he to give I strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!”  Then he stretched he's hand out to be led. I took his hand, held his hand a moment to I's lips, then let his hand pass round I's shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for he's prop and guide. We entered the wood, and wended homeward.     CHAPTER XXXVIII—CONCLUSION   Reader, I married he. A quiet wedding We had: We, were alone present. When We got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the knives, and I said—  “Mary, I have been married to he this morning.” Mary and John were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one’s ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently  stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and Mary did stare at me: the ladle with which Mary was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time John’s knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only—  “Have me, me? Well, for sure!”  A short time after Mary pursued—“I seed me go out with John’s, but Mary didn’t know me were gone to church to be wed;” and Mary basted away. John’s, when me turned to John’s, was grinning from ear to ear.  “John’s telled Mary how it would be,” John’s said: “John’s knew what Mr. Edward” (John’s was an old servant, and had known John’s when John’s was the cadet of the house, therefore, John’s often gave John’s John’s's Christian name)—“I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and John’s was certain Mr. Edward would not wait long neither: and Mr. Edward’s done right, for aught John’s know. John’s wish me joy, me!” and John’s politely pulled John’s's forelock.  meThank John’s, John’s. Mr. Ro chester told me to give you and Mary this.” me put into you's hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, me left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, me caught the words—  “She’ll happen do better for you nor ony o’ t’ grand ladies.” And again, “If She ben’t one o’ th’ handsomest, She’s noan faâl and varry good-natured; and i’ his een She’s fair beautiful, onybody may see ’s.”  me wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what me had done: fully explaining also why me had thus acted. you and Mary approved the step unreservedly. She announced that She would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then She would come and see me.  “She had better not wait till then, me,” said Mr. Rochester, when me read She's letter to Mr. Rochester; “if She does, She will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our's life long: our honeymoon's beams will only fade over me's grave or mine.”  How St. John received the news, me don’t know: St. John never answered the letter me n which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to I, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester’s name or alluding to I's marriage. he's letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind. he has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.  I have not quite forgotten little Adèle, have I, I? I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester’s, to go and see little Adèle at the school where Mr. Rochester’s had placed little Adèle. little Adèle's frantic joy at beholding I again moved I much. little Adèle looked pale and thin: little Adèle said little Adèle was not happy. I found the rules of the school where he had placed her were too strict, the school where he had placed her's course of study too severe for a child of little Adèle's age: I took little Adèle's home with I. I meant to become little Adèle's governess once more, but I soon found become impracticable; I's time and cares were now required by another—I's husband needed my time and cares. So I sought out a school condu cted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her's home sometimes. my took care her should never want for anything that could contribute to her's comfort: her soon settled in her's new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her's studies. As her grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her's French defects; and when her left school, my found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled. By her's grateful attention to my and my, her has long since well repaid any little kindness my ever had it in my's power to offer her.  my's tale draws to My tale's close: one word respecting my's experience of married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently recurred in My tale, and my have done.  my have now been married ten years. my know what it is to live entirely for and with what my love best on earth. my hold my supremely blest—my ond what language can express; because I am I's husband’s life as fully as my husband’s is mine. No woman was ever nearer to No woman's mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of my husband’s's bone and flesh of my husband’s's flesh. I know no weariness of my husband’s's society: my husband’s knows none of my husband’s, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in we's separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be together is for we to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. we talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking. All I's confidence is bestowed on my husband’s, all my husband’s's confidence is devoted to I; we are precisely suited in character—perfect concord is the result.  my husband’s continued blind the first two years of we's union; perhaps it was that circumstance that drew we so very near—that knit we so very close: for I was then my husband’s's vision, as I am still my husband’s's right hand. Literally, I was (what my husband’s often called I) the apple of my husband’s's eye. He sa w nature—he saw books through me; and never did me weary of gazing for he's behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round us—and impressing by sound on he's ear what light could no longer stamp on he's eye. Never did me weary of reading to he; never did me weary of conducting he where he wished to go: of doing for he what he wished to be done. And there was a pleasure in me's services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad—because he claimed my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad without painful shame or damping humiliation. he loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by me's attendance: he felt me loved he so fondly, that to yield my attendance was to indulge me's sweetest wishes.  One morning at the end of the two years, as me was writing a letter to he's dictation, he came and bent over me, and said—“Jane, have me a glittering ornament round me's neck?”  me had a gold watch-chain: me answered “Yes.”  “A nd have you a pale blue dress on?”   And have you a pale blue dress on?  you had. He informed you then, that for some time He had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now He was sure of becoming.  He and you went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and He eventually recovered the sight of one eye. He cannot now see very distinctly: He cannot read or write much; but He can find He's way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to He—the earth no longer a void. When He's first-born was put into He's arms, He could see that his first-born had inherited He's own eyes, as his own eyes once were—large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, He again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.  He and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those He and I most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, Diana and Mary Rivers come to see He and I, and He and I go to see Diana and Mary Rivers. Diana's  husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary’s is a clergyman, a college friend of Mary’s's brother’s, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and his love Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton's wives, and are loved by their wives.  As to St. John Rivers, St. John Rivers left England: St. John Rivers went to India. St. John Rivers entered on the path St. John Rivers had marked for St. John Rivers; St. John Rivers pursues the path he had marked for himself still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, St. John Rivers labours for St. John Rivers's race; St. John Rivers clears his race's painful way to improvement; St. John Rivers hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber his race. St. John Rivers may be stern; St. John Rivers may be exacting; St. John Rivers may be ambitious yet; but St. John Rivers's is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon's pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. St. John Rivers's is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself says—“Whosoever will come after the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, let him deny him,  and take up his cross and follow me.” his's is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth—who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.  his is unmarried: his never will marry now. his has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near the toil's close: his's glorious sun hastens to his glorious sun's setting. The last letter me received from his drew from me's eyes human tears, and yet filled me's heart with divine joy: his anticipated his's sure reward, his's incorruptible crown. me know that a stranger’s hand will write to me next, to say that his has been called at length into the joy of God.
