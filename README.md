# FOEP: Evaluating Female Objectification under the Male Gaze
## Abstract
Gender bias exists extensively in human-written and model-generated texts. Detecting gender bias in the form of female objectification requires unifying previous efforts
of measuring gender bias in semantics and in grammar. 

We propose the Female Objectification Evaluation Paradigm (FOEP), adopting the concept of the ‘male gaze’ from gender studies and literature analysis, which quantifies the level of objectification and emphasis on the visual pleasure of female characters in a novel. Applying our method to four novels as examples, the result indicates that restrictive female images are common in English novels both by female and male authors from the 19th and 20th centuries. Our paradigm presents a novel interdisciplinary outlook on the examination of gender bias, showing its efficacy in uncovering gender representations that are imbued with bias.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to our course instructor, Prof. Sophie Hao, for her invaluable comments on the paper and the project, as well as for her dedication to the course and its students. We also extend our appreciation to Prof.Laura Harris from Cinema Studies at NYU and Prof. Ann Pellegrini from Performance Studies at NYU for providing valuable feedback on the concept of the male gaze and its relevance to gender studies. Their insights greatly enhanced our understanding and enriched our research.


## Ethical Considerations
In our exploration of the ‘male gaze’ concept, we recognize the limitation of defining gender solely within binary categories. Critiques of the ‘male gaze’ concept rightly highlight its disregard for the presence of diverse gender identities beyond the binary labels of ‘female’ and ‘male’. To address this limitation, future research should aim
to expand upon our current work by adopting a more inclusive definition of gender that accounts for its diverse nature. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the primary objective of our study is to propose a new framework for evaluating gender bias, with insights drawn from social studies. However, it is essential to note that the
framework’s basic structure may not fully capture the nuanced perspectives of authors of the novels and should not be used as a means to discriminate against or attack any individuals or groups. Our intention is to foster a deeper understanding of gender representation and reduce representational harm in NLP, free from any discriminatory implications
